SustainableFashion,patagonia,For Days Review,"Edit: Since posting this, it looks like the business model for For Days has changed slightly w.r.t. how they provide vouchers for sending in the take back bag. Lots of comments touching on this, but their system seems to incentivize (surprise surprise) taking more of your money.

Hadn't seen many recent reviews of For Days, so I figured I would write one! Ordered back in the fall.

For Days was advertised to me on Instagram, and I finally bit (curse you algorithm!) and ordered their take back bag, then later a jumpsuit. I was intrigued by their take-back bag, mainly because I had a lot of clothes I knew I wanted to get rid of, and it seemed like a sustainable way to get rid of clothing versus blindly donating it somewhere.

How the Take Back Bag works - you order the bag, put your stuff in there (one thing that appealed to me is they take any sort of clothes; ripped, stained, linens, whatever), then ship the bag out using their provided label. I paid $20 for my bag, and that $20 is then converted into a credit for their online store.

Service - both the bag and the jumpsuit took a while to get to me. The bag wasn't shipped for weeks, enough that I got jumpy about being scammed and DMed them on Insta to figure out what was going on. They let me know they were busy, and had limited staff so orders would take a while. The jumpsuit took maybe two weeks from when I ordered it to when it was delivered.

Quality - bag is as expected; getting the label was easy enough. The jumpsuit I am disappointed in. The day I got it I liked it; it fit me pretty well and while the fabric didn't feel that nice, it felt solid enough. After one wash though, it felt pretty baggy around my butt (I am not huge in that area so it wasn't a me stretching it out problem) and the straps were already so stretched out despite me never hanging it up. I regret buying it, because now I have another piece of clothing that I don't really want or need. I will keep it for now for lounging in, but it's gone next chance I have to donate clothing. Older reviews I have seen mentioned similar issues, it's a shame they haven't corrected in the meantime.

Price - the bag feels more expensive, but of course you're really buying store credit. Clothes themselves. Original store prices are way overpriced for the quality; sale prices (which it seems like are not uncommon) seem much more fair.

Overall it's a bummer how disappointing it was! I appreciate their philosophy about circular economy but I would much rather keep putting my money in brands like Patagonia for clothing that will actually last.",1672612356.0,"For Days Review Edit: Since posting this, it looks like the business model for For Days has changed slightly w.r.t. how they provide vouchers for sending in the take back bag.

Price - the bag feels more expensive, but of course you're really buying store credit. Clothes themselves. Original store prices are way overpriced for the quality; sale prices (which it seems like are not uncommon) seem much more fair.

Overall it's a bummer how disappointing it was! I appreciate their philosophy about circular economy but I would much rather keep putting my money in brands like Patagonia for clothing that will actually last.","for days review edit since posting this it looks like the business model for for days has changed slightly wrt how they provide vouchers for sending in the take back bag lots of comments touching on this but their system seems to incentivize surprise surprise taking more of your money

hadnt seen many recent reviews of for days so i figured i would write one ordered back in the fall

for days was advertised to me on instagram and i finally bit curse you algorithm and ordered their take back bag then later a jumpsuit i was intrigued by their takeback bag mainly because i had a lot of clothes i knew i wanted to get rid of and it seemed like a sustainable way to get rid of clothing versus blindly donating it somewhere

how the take back bag works  you order the bag put your stuff in there one thing that appealed to me is they take any sort of clothes ripped stained linens whatever then ship the bag out using their provided label i paid 20 for my bag and that 20 is then converted into a credit for their online store

service  both the bag and the jumpsuit took a while to get to me the bag wasnt shipped for weeks enough that i got jumpy about being scammed and dmed them on insta to figure out what was going on they let me know they were busy and had limited staff so orders would take a while the jumpsuit took maybe two weeks from when i ordered it to when it was delivered

quality  bag is as expected getting the label was easy enough the jumpsuit i am disappointed in the day i got it i liked it it fit me pretty well and while the fabric didnt feel that nice it felt solid enough after one wash though it felt pretty baggy around my butt i am not huge in that area so it wasnt a me stretching it out problem and the straps were already so stretched out despite me never hanging it up i regret buying it because now i have another piece of clothing that i dont really want or need i will keep it for now for lounging in but its gone next chance i have to donate clothing older reviews i have seen mentioned similar issues its a shame they havent corrected in the meantime

SustainableFashion,everlane,Why do you still buy Reformation & Everlane?,"Being in the sustainable fashion space I was pretty upset when the news of Everlane & Reformations employee abuses came to light.

SustainableFashion,everlane,Shopping second-hand sucks these days,"Preaching to the choir, but fast fashion is filling the shops with obviously low quality clothing, and I'm getting tired of thrifting.

SustainableFashion,everlane,I am DONE with Boyish Jeans. (Long post),"Hey y'all. This has been getting under my skin for a while now but it's come to a head in the last few days. I'd love to hear your perspective.

&#x200B;

I have been looking for a good US-based sustainable jeans company to support (that's not Everlane) for a while now. It's hard to find. When I found out about Boyish I was super excited- a sustaible denim co from LA? Awesome! I went to their website and was surprised to discover that they feature *only* ***extremely*** tall/thin models. This was disappointing to say the least but I thought, whatever. Then I discovered that they do not list the fit info for their jeans, just the length. So they don't show you what the jeans look like on curvier women and they don't list the fit for different sizes...How am I supposed to know how the jeans are going to fit?? They're online only! 

So I went to their IG to see if I could find more info, and maybe some examples of non-supermodels wearing their jeans. To my dismay, their feed consists **literally 100% of size 0-2 models**. I scrolled back for hundreds and hundreds of posts, and there was perhaps ONE single post that featured a woman larger than a size 2 (and she was maybe a 4/6). Something else became quite evident to me during my scrolling too- **they have a MAJOR diversity problem**. Going back about 100 posts I did not see ONE. SINGLE. BLACK. WOMAN. Well, perhaps *one* of their more recent posts *maybe could possibly* have been a black woman but they showed about 4 inches of her torso and *none of her face.* At around post 90 there was one woman who might be mixed but it's hard to tell. There were a small handful of Asian/Latina girls mixed in but the vast majority (\~80%) were white, white, WHITE white white. I was shocked. **Shocked.** 

I switched over to their tagged posts- it was more of the same. It was also *extremely* curated, leading me to believe that they are clearly untagging themselves from ""off-brand"" posts. Row after row after row of skinny white women, hardly a skin tone darker than ""medium"". I was just *disgusted.* 

Looking back through the posts they have received consistent if mild criticism regarding their lack of diversity in both size and color, and their response has always been ""we're working on it <3"". On 5/31 as all other sustainable brands  that I follow were making statements regarding the BLM movement and what actions they are taking, Boyish **continued to make post/stories featuring their products and white women instead.** They received backlash for this and for their lack of diversity and insensitivity but did not respond. 

The next day 6/1 they made a post saying simply **""We are heartbroken and saddened by the current events. Boyish has always been an equality brand of all people on Mama Earth, regardless of race, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender"".** This was not particularly well-received as glossed over the criticism of their exclusion of WOC and their insensitivity. They also did not actually reference the BLM movement or take any action (donation, links to specific organizations, etc). Furthermore, ""equality for all"" is not the issue, this is a blacks-specific issue and shoule be treated as such.

 6/2 (yesterday) they posted a blackout tile with the title ""Listening, #  BlackLivesMatter"". They were asked to delete the post as the IG algorithm has been driving large white corporation's voices with the  BLM # on black tiles to the top, drowning out those with actual valuable information ands input, which continues even after the # has been changed. They did not do so and continued to not acknowledge the comments from the last few days.  

&#x200B;

Overall I'm just extremely disappointed with their behavior. Their exclusion of WOC demonstrates an obvious implicit bias at best, and is flagrantly racist at worst. Their milquetoast attempts to hand-wave the accusations of racism away feel pandering. The only ""equality"" Boyish has demonstrated is their even-handedness at taking our money. Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mark Jeffreys was widely criticised in 2012 for intentionally excluding people from the brand who were too ""fat"", too ""uncool"" or too ""unamerican"". To quote Jeffreys, "" Good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people... A lot of people don't belong \[in our clothes\], and they can't belong."" **Boyish has shown us who they believe ""good looking people"" are, and who they think ""belong"" in their jeans, and it's not WOC and it's not anyone over a size 2.** It makes me sad.   


We need to hold sustainble corporations to a higher standard. Racism and sustainability go hand-in-hand. We cannot claim to care about the lives of people in third-world countries while contributing to systemic violence *here*. We should be recruiting *everyone possible* to the sustainable fashion force, not excluding them by saying they're not ""on-brand"" enough. **Now is not the time to let racism slide- now is the time to speak up!** 

&#x200B;

1) STOP posting to social media. They need to stop talking and start *listening.*

3) The hiring of POC, not just models but in all levels of their business, including in their executive, marketing, design and PR teams. 

4) Contacting experts in the field, BLM leaders, and their peers in the sustainable fashion industry to find out how they can do better.

5) Donations to the BLM cause or other organizations supporting POC 

6) Once this is completed, then and *only* then they should return to social media and make  a sincere apology and *openly address* the concerns that have been raised surrounding their lack of diversity and the specific changes they will be making.

Tl;Dr **Boyish Jeans feature exclusively thin women, and almsot exclusively white women, with the near-complete exclusion of black women. They have responded extremely poorly to these criticisms and have made delayed and half-hearted responses to pressure to comment on the BLM movement. Racism and exclusion has no place in sustainable fashion!**",1591209003.0,"I am DONE with Boyish Jeans. (Long post) Hey y'all. This has been getting under my skin for a while now but it's come to a head in the last few days. I'd love to hear your perspective.

&#x200B;

I have been looking for a good US-based sustainable jeans company to support (that's not Everlane) for a while now. It's hard to find. When I found out about Boyish I was super excited- a sustaible denim co from LA? Awesome! I went to their website and was surprised to discover that they feature *only* ***extremely*** tall/thin models. This was disappointing to say the least but I thought, whatever. Then I discovered that they do not list the fit info for their jeans, just the length. So they don't show you what the jeans look like on curvier women and they don't list the fit for different sizes...How am I supposed to know how the jeans are going to fit?? They're online only! 

So I went to their IG to see if I could find more info, and maybe some examples of non-supermodels wearing their jeans. To my dismay, their feed consists **literally 100% of size 0-2 models**. I scrolled back for hundreds and hundreds of posts, and there was perhaps ONE single post that featured a woman larger than a size 2 (and she was maybe a 4/6). Something else became quite evident to me during my scrolling too- **they have a MAJOR diversity problem**. Going back about 100 posts I did not see ONE. SINGLE. BLACK. WOMAN. Well, perhaps *one* of their more recent posts *maybe could possibly* have been a black woman but they showed about 4 inches of her torso and *none of her face.* At around post 90 there was one woman who might be mixed but it's hard to tell. There were a small handful of Asian/Latina girls mixed in but the vast majority (\~80%) were white, white, WHITE white white. I was shocked. **Shocked.** 

I switched over to their tagged posts- it was more of the same. It was also *extremely* curated, leading me to believe that they are clearly untagging themselves from ""off-brand"" posts. Row after row after row of skinny white women, hardly a skin tone darker than ""medium"". I was just *disgusted.* 

Looking back through the posts they have received consistent if mild criticism regarding their lack of diversity in both size and color, and their response has always been ""we're working on it <3"". On 5/31 as all other sustainable brands  that I follow were making statements regarding the BLM movement and what actions they are taking, Boyish **continued to make post/stories featuring their products and white women instead.** They received backlash for this and for their lack of diversity and insensitivity but did not respond. 

The next day 6/1 they made a post saying simply **""We are heartbroken and saddened by the current events. Boyish has always been an equality brand of all people on Mama Earth, regardless of race, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender"".** This was not particularly well-received as glossed over the criticism of their exclusion of WOC and their insensitivity. They also did not actually reference the BLM movement or take any action (donation, links to specific organizations, etc). Furthermore, ""equality for all"" is not the issue, this is a blacks-specific issue and shoule be treated as such.

 6/2 (yesterday) they posted a blackout tile with the title ""Listening, #  BlackLivesMatter"". They were asked to delete the post as the IG algorithm has been driving large white corporation's voices with the  BLM # on black tiles to the top, drowning out those with actual valuable information ands input, which continues even after the # has been changed. They did not do so and continued to not acknowledge the comments from the last few days.  

&#x200B;

Overall I'm just extremely disappointed with their behavior. Their exclusion of WOC demonstrates an obvious implicit bias at best, and is flagrantly racist at worst. Their milquetoast attempts to hand-wave the accusations of racism away feel pandering. The only ""equality"" Boyish has demonstrated is their even-handedness at taking our money. Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mark Jeffreys was widely criticised in 2012 for intentionally excluding people from the brand who were too ""fat"", too ""uncool"" or too ""unamerican"". To quote Jeffreys, "" Good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people... A lot of people don't belong \[in our clothes\], and they can't belong."" **Boyish has shown us who they believe ""good looking people"" are, and who they think ""belong"" in their jeans, and it's not WOC and it's not anyone over a size 2.** It makes me sad.   


We need to hold sustainble corporations to a higher standard. Racism and sustainability go hand-in-hand. We cannot claim to care about the lives of people in third-world countries while contributing to systemic violence *here*. We should be recruiting *everyone possible* to the sustainable fashion force, not excluding them by saying they're not ""on-brand"" enough. **Now is not the time to let racism slide- now is the time to speak up!** 

&#x200B;

**I have action items for Boyish if they really want to change. They are as follows.**

1) STOP posting to social media. They need to stop talking and start *listening.* 

2) Mandatory company-wide implicit bias training. This includes the CEO, the marketing team, the VP's, *everyone.*

5) Donations to the BLM cause or other organizations supporting POC 

6) Once this is completed, then and *only* then they should return to social media and make  a sincere apology and *openly address* the concerns that have been raised surrounding their lack of diversity and the specific changes they will be making.

SustainableFashion,everlane,Depop and the Rise of Slow Fashion," 

Did you know that the average American purchases a new piece of clothing every five days? Congruently, research has shown that 90% of our clothing is thrown away before it needs to be.

# Slow Fashion Vs. Fast Fashion

Slow fashion is about being more aware of how garments are made, bought, and worn. It is an approach to making clothing that thoughtfully considers all aspects of the supply chain. The goal of slow fashion is to respect people, the planet, and wildlife. The design process seeks to ensure that [***each article of clothing is well-made***](https://gpointmarket.com/product-category/women/clothing/jumpsuits-rompers/)***.***

Fast fashion has wrongly convinced us that you can never have enough clothes. The industry is lowering standards of quality, contributing to about 10% of all worldwide carbon emissions, and exploiting their workers.

üì∑

Rather than producing clothing inexpensively and fast, slow fashion focuses on pieces that use quality materials, evergreen styles, and built to last construction.

Slow fashion means buying fewer garments but of better quality. It encourages fashion enthusiasts to purchase well-made items and select pieces that resonate with their values.

Synchronistically, many brands, like LA-based labels[ ***Reformation***](https://www.thereformation.com/) and[ ***Everlane***](https://www.everlane.com/) are adopting the slow fashion methodology and some online retailers are beginning to create new spaces for the secondhand clothing market.

# Depop

Depop, for one, has had great success in marketing its user-driven online ‚Äúthrift store‚Äù by allowing fashion-forward folk to resell their favorite pieces to their friends and followers. Gen Z has taken to this new development in clothing resale like moths to a flame or, rather, moths to a vintage coat. This new platform allows users to find items they may not find anywhere else.

Independent brands are also using Depop to launch their fashion lines, bringing attention to smaller businesses and the hip, up-and-coming designers making it happen.

*‚ÄúWe have work to do to become the business we want to be. Our contribution to making changes happen both at Depop and beyond.

SustainableFashion,reformation,Best tips to start my journey? (I made this!!),"I have to admit, I am a fast fashion fiend üôà

I want to change my ways, and have ONLY been shopping second hand for clothes for the past couple months, but want more items that feel more like ‚Äúme‚Äù if that makes sense?

I am moving soon and will be donating or gifting the MAJORITY of my closet to make room for more sustainable lasting and age appropriate pieces.

I am also planning on asking for a new sewing machine for Christmas (my old one was my aunts from the 70s and the bobbin would always kink up so I gave up on it a few years ago)

I will source fabric secondhand or clearance from fabric stores. I am not new to making my own clothes (pic for reference!), and my mom is a wiz at sewing (though she bats away any comment of complete artistry), so she can always help in a pinch!

However, making the romper in that photo was a nightmare with all the different seams and technical details. So I am also looking for suggestions for good places to find affordable patterns that won‚Äôt drive me up a wall üòÖ

I would describe my style as ‚Äúgrounded maximalist‚Äù I guess? Or maybe ‚Äúrefined maximalist‚Äù? I grew up in DC so I tend more towards classier pieces, but with a little edginess or boho thrown in! I‚Äôm a big believer of ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in the details‚Äù! (Think Joie, Sezane, Mango, Reformation, ASTR, Vestique, Sabo Skirt, or literally anything Italian!)

I am approaching my 30s, FAST, so I also want to transform my wardrobe into more sophisticated and comfortable pieces, though I do like things relatively fitted.

Honestly, my main reason for doing this is both waste and price (both with longevity and sustained interest, but also ethical and moral implications as well)

I guess I‚Äôm looking for the following:
‚Äî‚Äî resources to help get me started and pin down some core values and practices
‚Äî‚Äî affordable sewing patterns or ideas for transforming secondhand items with sewing
‚Äî‚Äî tips from those that share a similar style and design as I tend towards
‚Äî‚Äî AFFORDABLE shops that won‚Äôt charge me $100+ for everything they make cuz I sincerely am on a fast fashion budget here and technically below the poverty line making less than $50k/yr USD (which is why I‚Äôm mostly going the DIY route!)

SustainableFashion,reformation,Ethical luxury in budget?,"Okay, so I‚Äôm ditching fast fashion for good. I love my current wardrobe, handbag, and beauty products, and other accessories but I'm consciously shifting towards more sustainable and affordable luxury options.

My priorities lie in a brand's commitment to sustainability, design aesthetic, material quality, craftsmanship, and ethical manufacturing. It's okay to pay a bit more for sustainable and well-made items, (but I don't wanna break the bank either.). especially since high-end luxury brands can be super expensive.

SustainableFashion,reformation,Depop and the Rise of Slow Fashion," 

Did you know that the average American purchases a new piece of clothing every five days? Congruently, research has shown that 90% of our clothing is thrown away before it needs to be.

# Slow Fashion Vs. Fast Fashion

Slow fashion is about being more aware of how garments are made, bought, and worn. It is an approach to making clothing that thoughtfully considers all aspects of the supply chain. The goal of slow fashion is to respect people, the planet, and wildlife. The design process seeks to ensure that [***each article of clothing is well-made***](https://gpointmarket.com/product-category/women/clothing/jumpsuits-rompers/)***.***

Fast fashion has wrongly convinced us that you can never have enough clothes. The industry is lowering standards of quality, contributing to about 10% of all worldwide carbon emissions, and exploiting their workers.

üì∑

Rather than producing clothing inexpensively and fast, slow fashion focuses on pieces that use quality materials, evergreen styles, and built to last construction.

Slow fashion means buying fewer garments but of better quality. It encourages fashion enthusiasts to purchase well-made items and select pieces that resonate with their values.

Synchronistically, many brands, like LA-based labels[ ***Reformation***](https://www.thereformation.com/) and[ ***Everlane***](https://www.everlane.com/) are adopting the slow fashion methodology and some online retailers are beginning to create new spaces for the secondhand clothing market.

# Depop

Depop, for one, has had great success in marketing its user-driven online ‚Äúthrift store‚Äù by allowing fashion-forward folk to resell their favorite pieces to their friends and followers. Gen Z has taken to this new development in clothing resale like moths to a flame or, rather, moths to a vintage coat. This new platform allows users to find items they may not find anywhere else.

Independent brands are also using Depop to launch their fashion lines, bringing attention to smaller businesses and the hip, up-and-coming designers making it happen.

üì∑

*‚ÄúWe have work to do to become the business we want to be. Our contribution to making changes happen both at Depop and beyond. We don‚Äôt know what the world will look like in 2030 which is why we decided to focus on creating an intensive two-year plan.

I came across a Top 60 list for 2019 from sustainable fashion brand **Goose Studios** \- and it's seriously good! Great range of women's, men's and all budgets and styles - genuinely a brand for everyone, go check it out - they've even actually bothered to describe what you'll find from each brand and how they're sustainable.  


[https://goosestudios.co.uk/blogs/sustainable-fashion-blog/sustainable-fashion-brands](https://goosestudios.co.uk/blogs/sustainable-fashion-blog/sustainable-fashion-brands)  


The Goose Studios stuff is pretty great too. I've just got ordered of their laid back 100% GOTS organic cotton long sleeve tee's and they're a PETA-approved Vegan brand too.  


Thought i'd list out all the brands in their list (and a few extras i've come across) as a new master list for 2019. Comment below with more that you know of too and lets create the best list on the web!  


I've linked all their websites too - so just click away :)

SustainableFashion,allbirds,Looking for durable sneakers for plenty of walking,"I‚Äôm looking for sustainable sneakers but so far I couldn‚Äôt really find anything that really works for me. I‚Äôm aware that similar questions were asked before, but none of them really answered my question. 

I walk around 11-12 kms a day on average, so comfort and durability would be a top priority. I tend to prefer softer soles, but open to suggestions. I‚Äôm fine with leather as long as it‚Äôs high quality and durable. 

I do like Vans Ultrarange shoes but they‚Äôre not great for sustainability. I‚Äôm also fine with Vans and more skater designs in general. The classic New Balance shoes also look fine. 

I know a common suggestion is Cariuma, I tried them but they didn‚Äôt really hold up with walking a lot. Buying a new pair every few months isn‚Äôt really sustainable, right? (They weren‚Äôt that comfy either.)

I‚Äôm also aware of Allbirds, but I personally really really don‚Äôt like the way they look. (And by that I mean I would not buy one.) 

I‚Äôm somewhat indifferent about Veja, I don‚Äôt find them exciting, but if people say they‚Äôre super durable, I might consider one. 

I‚Äôve also seen a German brand called Genesis, but couldn‚Äôt really find anything about their longevity. Does anyone have experience with them?

SustainableFashion,allbirds,Any Recommendations on Sustainable/Ethical Shoes that a comfortable?,"I'm pregnant and I'm looking to purchase some new shoes for the winter. I live in Florida so weather isn't a huge issue. My day to day shoes are white air force 1s which I want to keep or potentially sell/rehome, but in the meantime I can't keep wearing them everyday. They are so uncomfortable and they kind of screw up my feet.

I've looked at secondhand reeboks, but I'd much rather buy a smaller sustainable brand so when people ask I can say ""their sustainable and such an easy swap"". But I have some caveats, I'd prefer white or a lighter color, they need to lace up but still could be slipped on if necessary, and most of all they have to be comfortable. 

I was considering allbirds but I'm unsure due to their sizing. I'm an 8.5 narrow and they only come in whole sizes. I'd be fine with an 8, but my feet swelled up pretty bad with my last pregnancy so I'm a little worried.

i really want to pick a shoe that will last me a long time and don't want to have to return and try a bunch of different brands.

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,Sustainable vs. Ethical Clothing Brands: What's the Difference?,"In recent years, the fashion industry has seen a growing demand for brands that are more responsible‚Äîwhether that means reducing their environmental impact or ensuring fair treatment of workers. But when shopping for conscious fashion, you may come across two key terms: sustainable and ethical. While they are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to different aspects of responsible fashion.

So, what exactly is the difference between sustainable clothing brands and ethical clothing brands? And why does it matter?

# Sustainable Clothing Brands: Prioritising the Planet üå±

Sustainable fashion focuses on minimising the environmental footprint of clothing production. This means using materials, processes, and practices that reduce waste, conserve resources, and lower pollution.

‚úî Eco-Friendly Fabrics ‚Äì Sustainable brands prioritise natural fibers like organic cotton, linen, hemp, TENCEL‚Ñ¢, and recycled fibers over synthetic fabrics like polyester, which contribute to microplastic pollution.

‚úî Low-Impact Dyes & Non-Toxic Processing ‚Äì Many sustainable brands use plant-based or OEKO-TEX¬Æ certified dyes to reduce water contamination and limit chemical exposure.

‚úî Reducing Waste ‚Äì Many brands focus on zero-waste production, recycling materials, and upcycling fabric scraps to prevent excess landfill waste.

‚úî Slow Fashion Over Fast Fashion ‚Äì Rather than mass-producing trendy, low-quality clothing, sustainable brands create timeless, high-quality pieces meant to last for years, reducing overconsumption.

‚úî Lower Carbon Footprint ‚Äì Sustainable brands aim to reduce energy use, invest in renewable energy sources, and choose local production to cut down on emissions from transportation.

# Ethical Clothing Brands: Putting People First ü§ù

Ethical fashion is all about fair treatment of the people who make our clothes. Many fast fashion brands exploit workers by underpaying them, forcing long hours, or making them work in unsafe conditions. Ethical brands prioritize human rights, fair wages, and safe working conditions.

‚úî Fair Wages & Labor Practices ‚Äì Ethical brands ensure their workers receive living wages rather than just minimum wages, often following Fair Trade guidelines.

‚úî Safe & Healthy Work Environments ‚Äì Many fashion workers operate in dangerous factories with little ventilation, exposure to harmful chemicals, and extreme heat. Ethical brands commit to safe workplaces and reasonable working hours.

‚úî No Child or Forced Labor ‚Äì A shocking number of garment workers are children or people forced into labor under exploitative conditions. Ethical brands work with certified, audited factories to ensure humane treatment of all workers.

‚úî Transparency & Accountability ‚Äì Ethical brands are open about their supply chains, sharing information on who makes their clothing, where factories are located, and how workers are treated.

‚úî Supporting Local Artisans & Communities ‚Äì Some ethical brands work with artisan cooperatives, helping traditional craftsmen and women preserve their skills while earning fair wages.

# Can a Brand Be Both Sustainable & Ethical?

Yes! Many brands strive to be both sustainable and ethical, but it‚Äôs not always guaranteed. Some brands may use eco-friendly fabrics but still exploit workers, while others might focus on fair wages but still rely on synthetic materials that harm the planet.

If you want to support brands that care for both people and the planet and avoid greenwashing, look for certifications that prove a brand's commitment such as:üåø GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) ‚Äì Ensures organic fabrics and environmentally responsible production.ü§ù Fair Trade Certified ‚Äì Guarantees ethical labor practices and fair wages.üîç B Corp Certification ‚Äì Recognizes brands that meet high environmental and social standards.‚ôª OEKO-TEX¬Æ ‚Äì Ensures textiles are free from harmful chemicals.

# How to Shop More Consciously

When shopping, ask yourself:

‚úÖ Who made this? (Is the brand transparent about its labor practices?)

‚úÖ What is it made from? (Are the materials sustainable and non-toxic?)

‚úÖ Will it last? (Is it well-made, or will it fall apart after a few wears?)

‚úÖ What does the brand stand for? (Are they actively working to reduce their impact?)

By choosing brands that align with both sustainability and ethics, you can feel good about where your clothes come from and how they were made. üåç‚ú®

[The Hempton Classic Shirt - Arctic White ](https://preview.redd.it/o8h7vm9enbm41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2717178e9af8fd12eeb5a4c3db192d83eb169eee)

Last week, I launched my very own Vegan, Sustainable & Ethical Clothing Brand for women. I decided to launch Hempton after quitting my job and travelling the world for almost 2 years - I travelled over 25,000km overland on public transport across Africa, Asia, Middle East and Europe. One of my biggest frustrations was that much of the clothing for travel is made from wool, or synthetics (which is very bad for the environment).I would love if you could check out my page here :) It is just me, so a very small business. My factory is ethical and is certified by the Fair Wear Foundation, as this was a big reasoning for launching my own brand - How animals, and people are treated is the most important thing to me personally.

Last week, I launched my very own Vegan, Sustainable & Ethical Clothing Brand for women. I decided to launch Hempton after quitting my job and travelling the world for almost 2 years - I travelled over 25,000km overland on public transport across Africa, Asia, Middle East and Europe. One of my biggest frustrations was that much of the clothing for travel is made from wool, or synthetics (which is very bad for the environment).I would love if you could check out my page here :) It is just me, so a very small business. My factory is ethical and is certified by the Fair Wear Foundation, as this was a big reasoning for launching my own brand - How animals, and people are treated is the most important thing to me personally.

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,Shien,"Hey everyone, I would really like to know everyone‚Äôs opinion on this. I personally have always been against shien with seeing everyone doing their ‚Äúweekly shopping hauls‚Äù and just how bad of a company it is in general. I‚Äôm not the most sustainable person I admit but fast fashion to an extent like shein/shien (idk how it‚Äôs spelt) is something I‚Äôve never wanted to support

This is however where my question comes in
I‚Äôm a 16 year old with a job so I have money but not enough to afford a lot and I was looking to upgrade my style so I was wondering if it was okay to buy from them if I‚Äôm not doing it to such a large extent like others are. I really want to start wearing better clothes but it‚Äôs just really hard to find affordable brands with clothes that I like. 

It would be great to get to know everyone‚Äôs opinions or if they have cheap yet ethical clothing brands that they‚Äôd recommend instead ! Tysm

Edit: thank you guys for all your responses! I‚Äôm going to have a look at online websites like mecari and depop like suggested and I made plans a few days ago to go thrifting with a friend anyways so I will definitely be avoiding shien! Not only because of how fast fashion they are but the chemicals, worker mistreatment etc. and I feel like if I were to buy from them I‚Äôd immediately feel regret and go against my own morals, so I‚Äôll definitely stay avoiding them!!

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,Why do sustainable clothing brands only offer simple designs?!,"The fashion industry is in terrible shape when it comes to sustainability and ethical values, primarily due to fast fashion. I‚Äôm someone who values knowing how my clothes are made and where they come from, because I don‚Äôt want to contribute to the incredibly polluting fashion industry.

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,Rant + Need Brand Recommendations,"Hello

I feel like most of the brands around me are running on fast fashion models even though they don't call themselves that. They consider themselves exclusive with ""good quality"" clothes just because of their price range. But to be honest most of them start unravelling after first wear, so the quality is definitely not there. The other problem I have is of ethics. I see a lot of ""luxury"" and ""high-end"" brands copy designs and even artworks (I know using public domain images is different but they weren't using those) from the internet just for faster production. I have also seen them waste a lot of fabric during the sampling process, which they claim to recycle but I have seen bags of them just lying there. The whole process of thoughtfully designing a collection is losing value. Everything looks the same now, at least where I live, and they all lie about their fabric properties and quality.  

Which is why I have been researching on sustainable and ethical fashion and I came across limited brands like mud jeans. I understand their main mission is to reduce their carbon footprint and minimize overconsumption in the industry, and some tend to focus on introducing eco-friendly fabrics, but the designs are often similar and... plain. I really want to find good designs that are sustainable and from a slow fashion brand. 

Can anyone recommend me good sustainable/slow fashion brands like farm rio? I don't mind the price range since I understand the point of slow fashion. I would like to slowly start investing in good pieces and support these brands. Even start-ups are cool. ",1749755451.0,"Rant + Need Brand Recommendations Hello

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,Sustainable version of this dress,"Like the title says, I'm looking for a sustainably sourced, ethically produced, dress like the one pictured. The dress, of course, has pockets.

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,Found a lovely slow fashion brand from India ‚Äî The Good Artisan,"I recently came across¬†*The Good Artisan*, a small women-led brand based in India that makes breathable cotton clothing in beautiful hand block prints.

What stood out to me:

* They offer inclusive sizing (XS to 5XL), which is rare in artisanal fashion.
* The cotton is super soft and feels great on sensitive skin.
* Their packaging was minimal and eco-conscious, and they included a founder's note, which felt personal.

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,"Built my brand with GOTS, Fair Trade & SUPIMA cotton‚Äîhere‚Äôs what worked (and what didn‚Äôt)","Hey folks,

After a long year of sourcing and building, I finally launched my ethical clothing brand‚Äîand wanted to share a bit of the experience that this community helped shape. From GOTS-certified organic cotton to Fair Trade and WRAP-certified factories, it‚Äôs been a huge learning curve with some compromises along the way.

Here‚Äôs a snapshot of what worked‚Äîand where I had to make tough calls:

Sourcing fully traceable materials is harder than expected, especially when trying to avoid greenwashing and verify certifications.

Most of our products are 100% natural fiber‚Äîlike SUPIMA cotton tees and organic heavyweight cotton pieces.

But for a few items (like hoodies and sweatpants), the fabric includes around 20% recycled polyester. It was the only way to get the structure and durability we needed while working with mills that still met Fair Trade and GOTS certification where possible.

We use plastic-free packaging‚Äîrecycled kraft paper, compostable mailers, and zero polybags. This actually took more work than product development.

No sweatshops, and we plant one tree for every product sold to give back in a small but tangible way.

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,"The ""natural is more sustainable"" ethical fallacy","Okay I got time today. Let's read these articles or any of the many others out there with real data on life cycle emissions and environmental impacts of fashion. https://rootthefuture.com/is-animal-leather-better-for-the-environment-than-vegan-leather/ and https://www.collectivefashionjustice.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions. 

The second article in particular is why I stopped buying new clothes entirely, since I'd rather thrift than buy an expensive sustainable brand. But I see people defending leather here often so I want to share some data on the industry's impacts. 

Why do most people believe animal leather is more sustainable than (even the cheap plastic kind of) vegan leather? The animal agriculture lobby! Since the Ipcc first published it's landmark climate report on the contributions of animal agriculture to global climate collapse, big meat hired the same lawyers used by big oil and tobacco to being misleading us about the climate science. There's lots of articles about this, watch the latest ClimateTown YouTube video for a deep dive!

Fashion marketers caught on, and we all know how the production of clothing, especially cheap fash fashion, has exploded over the past decade. You've probably heard the often repeated claim that there are enough clothes on the planet right now to clothe the next seven generations. To avoid the risks of consumers shopping less to reduce their environmental impacts, fashion brands began greenwashing their products. You see that with even all-polyester brands like H&M suddenly having a ""sustainability"" line.

But what about leather? It's a status symbol of luxury and a by-product of the meat industry. And since meat consumption continues to go up and up each year, fashion brands have to sell more and more leather. Dropping the price would make them less money, so instead they began marketing it as greener than PU/PVC vegan leather to justify the higher price. The most common greenwashing tactic? The appeal to nature fallacy. That because leather isn't synthetic (except for all the chemicals used in processing), then it's by default better for the environment.

So yeah I can talk about this more and answer questions from people in the comments! I'm a climate scientist (though not related to fashion) and passionate about making evidence-based sustainable choices, so let's all learn together!

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,American Apparel Baby Doll Dress Rayon,"In the last year I have been converting my wardrobe to all natural fiber garments. I thrift and buy second hand for a ton of my stuff in order to achieve this as cost effectively as possible.

  
I'm pregnant with my 3rd kid and went to goodwill to just and find more pregnancy-friendly clothing. While there I found a pretty iconic score: The American Apparel baby doll dress.

I want to say these were made between 2008-2011. I have found one before. This is an all-black on; which is most ideal. Anyways, I have one and they are AMAZING when pregnant. 

I looked at the tag and it's Rayon. Boohoo. Anyways, I bought it because I could not walk away from it and figured I'd do my research and take it back if the conclusion was bad.

  
Rayon has always been one of those fibers I just not sure about. I don't think I'd buy Rayon brand new, but I'm wondering if used makes it better, since a majority of the chemicals are washed out.

  
The other point is American Apparel ""seems"" to have more ethical manufacturing practices. Their garments are also USA-made.

  
Does anyone have an opinion on this? Any information they would like to share? I obviously want to be careful about what I'm putting on my body pregnant.

SustainableFashion,ethical clothing,"Sustainable, fun and ""sexy"" designers/brands?","Hello, as a 19 year old girl who is dating around and going out a lot I never see a lot of options for sustainable designers. It is very easy to get mislead by vague paragraphs about brands sustainability and ethics, especially as someone who has unfortunately not been as knowledgeable on this topic previously. I recently bought a 300 dollar dress only to find out from a friend that while the materials are good, the brand uses sweatshops in 3rd world countries for cheap and hard labour which I find cruel. 

I have always thought that ""luxury"" brands would actually take care of their workers based on the price they charge the customers, but I find that to be naive and stupid of me and I hope to do my part in humanity and minimise the impact of my consumption choices on the exploitation of workers. I plan to be more mindful and support brands that are transparent about their labor practices and prioritize fair treatment of their employees.

So if you could drop any recommendations of brands or boutiques (in store around the tri-state area only please) where you know for a fact the workers are compensated fairly well it would be much appreciated, as most of the ones I have seen so far are very classy and professional clothing and not what I am looking for.

Jana wears 'natural' makeup, pants suits, glasses, and short curly hair while many anchors are manicured, in heels, wearing tight dresses and heavy makeup. 
You can watch her on the Today Show discussing it here: https://www.today.com/series/love-your-body/nbc-kare-11-s-jana-shortal-breaks-unspoken-dress-code-t151751

Of course, breaking the norm does not go unpunished. When covering the tragic Jacob Wetterling case, Jana wore jeans and a Twin Cities columnist shamed her for it.

And so, without further ado‚Ä¶

**HOW TO SURVIVE COLD AND SNOW WITHOUT DYING**

1 **Layer the shit out of everything**

You‚Äôre wearing a t-shirt and a cardigan?  That shit might be good enough for Florida.  It‚Äôs not going to cut it when the cold winds blow in the north.  You better be wearing a cami and a shirt and a sweater under a jacket which is under a coat which is accessorized with a scarf and a hat and mittens‚Ä¶  Basically, check in the mirror before you leave the house.  Do you look like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/Stay-puft-marshmallow-man.jpg)?  No?  GO PUT MORE CLOTHES ON.

2 **‚ÄùBut that doesn‚Äôt look good!‚Äù**

First of all - do you want to die?  No?  Then it‚Äôs totally worth it.  Second of all - cute in the cold is all relative.  It‚Äôs like surfer style.  It‚Äôs its own deal and ‚Äúcute for super cold‚Äù isn‚Äôt the same as ‚Äúcute for not super cold‚Äù.  It‚Äôs like wearing a raincoat when it‚Äôs raining out.  Wearing a less cute one is better than wearing a super cute one and getting wet and cold. At a certain temperature, practical and functional take precedence. The ‚Äòcute‚Äô outfits you see a lot of bloggers wearing are [not realistic](http://www.thecollegeprepster.com/2014/12/ask-blogger-arent-you-cold.html) for the weather. Once the temperature drops, you won‚Äôt be out of place [in a sea of parkas](http://i.imgur.com/wDXpoJW.jpg).

3 **Materials**

Natural materials like wool, silk, down, and fur will often be warmer than their synthetic counterparts. Many retailers offer ethical down options and provide information about how their materials are sourced. Wearing good materials will totally help with keeping warm.

*For a base layer* in super cold, silk or merino wool long underwear are the best shit you can ever own.  It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs amazing.  My mom has had the same silk long underwear for over 30 years.  She really only wears it when snowmobiling or downhill skiing because otherwise it‚Äôs too warm, but even so it‚Äôs lasted really well.  Both silk and merino wool are not only super warm but also super thin so it fits under everything. Often, they will be warmer than their synthetic alternatives at a similar thickness.  Merino wool also has awesome moisture wicking properties so if you do sweat it won‚Äôt make you chilled, and most silks are treated to provide better moisture wicking as well. Merino wool has the added benefit of being naturally antibacterial. If you don‚Äôt want to spend the money on silk or wool long underwear, **Uniqlo Heattech** is a pretty good alternative at a cheaper price.  Keep in mind it‚Äôs super thin, though (so it will fit under clothes) so you can‚Äôt wear it as say - pants.

*For pants* - wool is your best bet if you‚Äôre working in an office and need professional dress pants.  Some people feel that wool is too scratchy even lined, so be aware if your skin is okay with it.  I love wool dress pants in the winter.  So classy and so warm.  Plus a silky lining against your skin tends to feel super nice.  Jeans are notoriously chilly in the winter.  I don‚Äôt know what it is about denim but wind goes straight through.  Jeans with a base layer is super warm and I would recommend it highly but without a base layer is probably going to be too cold.  Thick leggings, ponte pants or fleece lined leggings/tights are really nice and cozy on their own I‚Äôve found unless there‚Äôs a strong wind. 

*For sweaters* - wool is your friend.  Cashmere is ideal, but imo all wools are fantastic.  So warm and wool handles moisture really well so you don‚Äôt end up cold and wet.  Fleece is a terrible coat but a great jacket to wear under a coat.  The wind goes straight through, but if it‚Äôs protected from wind it‚Äôs an excellent insulator.

*As far as outerwear*, wool is great.  Fleece lined gloves and hats are the holy grail.  I had a pair of leather gloves that were fleece lined that were one of my best cold weather items ever.  So warm but light enough to drive in.  If your head and ears get cold fleece lined hats can be found anywhere that sells ski gear.  Coziest beanies on the planet.  :)  Coats in wool, leather (lined, preferably with something thick and fluffy) or down are the best.  Down will be the warmest, but can get pretty wet if you‚Äôre not in a super cold or dry climate, so keep an eye out for ‚Äòwaterproof‚Äô (not water resistant) parkas.  Wool handles wet the best but does have a distinctive wet wool ‚Äòsmell‚Äô.  Leather is a good balance between the two.  Waterproofing is particularly important in gloves and coats since once you‚Äôre wet, you‚Äôre cold.

4 **Wear a long coat with a high collar.**

I thought long coats were ‚Äúuncool‚Äù for a super long time (yay highschool insecurity) but once I started wearing long coats I could never go back.  A midlength coat goes a long way in ensuring that your midsection doesn‚Äôt get exposed to the cold and gives you something warm and dry to sit on and a super long coat ensures that your legs are always warm and that they never have to touch anything cold or wet.  I tried to buy coats that fell no more than a couple inches above my ankle.  It‚Äôs like a column of warmth.  Also, a high collar is so great.  If you buy a peacoat make sure that the collar will button up all the way.  Lots of them only lay open, and that leaves you a big V in the front for cold air to get into.  Also, hoods are pretty dope.

5 **Be aware of footwear.**

One thing I learned is that if your feet are cold, your whole body will be cold.  Wool socks are your friend.  **Smartwool** is really the best imo, but some people prefer **Darn Tough**.  For cheaper alternatives **Costco** has amazing wool socks and I‚Äôve bought good ones in sporting stores too.  I bought some Hue wool socks this year that aren‚Äôt nearly as warm as my heavy-duty sporting good store socks or smartwool but are a good lightweight wool.  Forget other socks exist for the winter.  If you‚Äôre wearing tights, wear wool socks over your tights and then boots.  It‚Äôs the best way.

Wear shoes that keep your feet dry.  One thing with footwear is to be aware of what your life is like.  I wore normal shoes with wool socks all winter in northern WI even though temps dropped as low as -40 pretty regularly simply because I went from my house to my car to where ever I was going and was never outside for more than 20 minutes.  If you‚Äôre outside for longer, you need snow boots.  **Sorel** is one of the best out there as far as snow boots go.  **LL Bean**‚Äôs duck boots tend to be very popular, but the traditional boot will likely need to be layered with thick socks; they also offer insulated versions for winter conditions.  When it comes to snow boots, buy for function not for looks.  You want them to be warm, always, and you do not want to be slipping, sliding, and falling on poorly cleared sidewalks.  If you‚Äôre only outside for short periods normal boots should be fine, just be aware of a couple things.  a) will they keep your feet dry?  b) thick soles get your feet further off the ground keeping them from getting as cold.  c)  you need room for wool socks.  d) will they be stained by road salt?  d) make sure they‚Äôre not slick on ice or you‚Äôll hurt yourself.

6 **Be conscious of cold spots and work toward getting rid of them.**

Different people get cold in different places.  Personally, I found that my neck and chest being exposed always makes me cold.  Turtlenecks and scarves are essential for me keeping warm when it‚Äôs cold out.  I also get super cold feet.  So I make sure to always always wear warm socks.  Keep this in mind.  If you notice you‚Äôre always way colder if you‚Äôre not wearing a hat, wear a hat always.  It will help keep the rest of your body warm.  If you get cold hands, invest in great mittens.  Etc.  

At the end of the day living in the cold is all about being aware of your body.  Realizing where you‚Äôre cold and finding ways to solve that problem.  Style is always important, but when it‚Äôs between frostbite and stylish or not stylish and warm - always choose warm.  Also, like I said.  Watch what the people around you are wearing.  Most cold weather places definitely have a cold weather style that goes along with them.

Much thanks to /u/m1001101 for helping with the guide, adding info and links, and most of all hounding me until I actually did it.  :) ","the beginners guide to not freezing to death so if ffa is to be believed there are women all over the world utterly unprepared for the the bitter cold of winter  questions about how not to turn into a living ice cube are right up there with questions about what to take on vacation  too long ffa has been lacking a guide that tackles the perils of living in a cold climate  now winter is coming and there is still no guide to help you learn how to not freeze when you suddenly find yourself in the great white north  until now  this is not the guidetoendallguides obviously but just my experiences after living my whole life in the frozen tundra know as wisconsin  and so without further ado 

how to survive cold and snow without dying

1 layer the shit out of everything

you re wearing a tshirt and a cardigan  that shit might be good enough for florida  it s not going to cut it when the cold winds blow in the north  you better be wearing a cami and a shirt and a sweater under a jacket which is under a coat which is accessorized with a scarf and a hat and mittens   basically check in the mirror before you leave the house  do you look like this  no  go put more clothes on

2  but that doesn t look good 

first of all  do you want to die  no  then it s totally worth it  second of all  cute in the cold is all relative  it s like surfer style  it s its own deal and  cute for super cold  isn t the same as  cute for not super cold   it s like wearing a raincoat when it s raining out  wearing a less cute one is better than wearing a super cute one and getting wet and cold at a certain temperature practical and functional take precedence the  cute  outfits you see a lot of bloggers wearing are not realistic for the weather once the temperature drops you won t be out of place in a sea of parkas

3 materials

natural materials like wool silk down and fur will often be warmer than their synthetic counterparts many retailers offer ethical down options and provide information about how their materials are sourced wearing good materials will totally help with keeping warm

for a base layer in super cold silk or merino wool long underwear are the best shit you can ever own  it s not cheap but it s amazing  my mom has had the same silk long underwear for over 30 years  she really only wears it when snowmobiling or downhill skiing because otherwise it s too warm but even so it s lasted really well  both silk and merino wool are not only super warm but also super thin so it fits under everything often they will be warmer than their synthetic alternatives at a similar thickness  merino wool also has awesome moisture wicking properties so if you do sweat it won t make you chilled and most silks are treated to provide better moisture wicking as well merino wool has the added benefit of being naturally antibacterial if you don t want to spend the money on silk or wool long underwear uniqlo heattech is a pretty good alternative at a cheaper price  keep in mind it s super thin though so it will fit under clothes so you can t wear it as say  pants

for pants  wool is your best bet if you re working in an office and need professional dress pants  some people feel that wool is too scratchy even lined so be aware if your skin is okay with it  i love wool dress pants in the winter  so classy and so warm  plus a silky lining against your skin tends to feel super nice  jeans are notoriously chilly in the winter  i don t know what it is about denim but wind goes straight through  jeans with a base layer is super warm and i would recommend it highly but without a base layer is probably going to be too cold  thick leggings ponte pants or fleece lined leggingstights are really nice and cozy on their own i ve found unless there s a strong wind 

for sweaters  wool is your friend  cashmere is ideal but imo all wools are fantastic  so warm and wool handles moisture really well so you don t end up cold and wet  fleece is a terrible coat but a great jacket to wear under a coat  the wind goes straight through but if it s protected from wind it s an excellent insulator

as far as outerwear wool is great  fleece lined gloves and hats are the holy grail  i had a pair of leather gloves that were fleece lined that were one of my best cold weather items ever  so warm but light enough to drive in  if your head and ears get cold fleece lined hats can be found anywhere that sells ski gear  coziest beanies on the planet    coats in wool leather lined preferably with something thick and fluffy or down are the best  down will be the warmest but can get pretty wet if you re not in a super cold or dry climate so keep an eye out for  waterproof  not water resistant parkas  wool handles wet the best but does have a distinctive wet wool  smell   leather is a good balance between the two  waterproofing is particularly important in gloves and coats since once you re wet you re cold

4 wear a long coat with a high collar

i thought long coats were  uncool  for a super long time yay highschool insecurity but once i started wearing long coats i could never go back  a midlength coat goes a long way in ensuring that your midsection doesn t get exposed to the cold and gives you something warm and dry to sit on and a super long coat ensures that your legs are always warm and that they never have to touch anything cold or wet  i tried to buy coats that fell no more than a couple inches above my ankle  it s like a column of warmth  also a high collar is so great  if you buy a peacoat make sure that the collar will button up all the way  lots of them only lay open and that leaves you a big v in the front for cold air to get into  also hoods are pretty dope

5 be aware of footwear

one thing i learned is that if your feet are cold your whole body will be cold  wool socks are your friend  smartwool is really the best imo but some people prefer darn tough  for cheaper alternatives costco has amazing wool socks and i ve bought good ones in sporting stores too  i bought some hue wool socks this year that aren t nearly as warm as my heavyduty sporting good store socks or smartwool but are a good lightweight wool  forget other socks exist for the winter  if you re wearing tights wear wool socks over your tights and then boots  it s the best way

wear shoes that keep your feet dry  one thing with footwear is to be aware of what your life is like  i wore normal shoes with wool socks all winter in northern wi even though temps dropped as low as 40 pretty regularly simply because i went from my house to my car to where ever i was going and was never outside for more than 20 minutes  if you re outside for longer you need snow boots  sorel is one of the best out there as far as snow boots go  ll bean s duck boots tend to be very popular but the traditional boot will likely need to be layered with thick socks they also offer insulated versions for winter conditions  when it comes to snow boots buy for function not for looks  you want them to be warm always and you do not want to be slipping sliding and falling on poorly cleared sidewalks  if you re only outside for short periods normal boots should be fine just be aware of a couple things  a will they keep your feet dry  b thick soles get your feet further off the ground keeping them from getting as cold  c  you need room for wool socks  d will they be stained by road salt  d make sure they re not slick on ice or you ll hurt yourself

6 be conscious of cold spots and work toward getting rid of them

different people get cold in different places  personally i found that my neck and chest being exposed always makes me cold  turtlenecks and scarves are essential for me keeping warm when it s cold out  i also get super cold feet  so i make sure to always always wear warm socks  keep this in mind  if you notice you re always way colder if you re not wearing a hat wear a hat always  it will help keep the rest of your body warm  if you get cold hands invest in great mittens  etc  

at the end of the day living in the cold is all about being aware of your body  realizing where you re cold and finding ways to solve that problem  style is always important but when it s between frostbite and stylish or not stylish and warm  always choose warm  also like i said  watch what the people around you are wearing  most cold weather places definitely have a cold weather style that goes along with them

femalefashionadvice,patagonia,An overthinker's list of Fjallraven Kanken alternatives,"**UPDATED AS OF MARCH 20**

*(I'd been composing this megalist since before the COVID-19 outbreak, but I figured now is as good a time as any.)*

So for whatever reason the Fjallraven Kanken became one of those super-trendy Instagram-worthy bags. So trendy, in fact, that I'm now seeing tons of newer (and/or arguably better) bags with looks and features reminiscent of the Kanken. And because I've become fascinated with this fad in the last couple of months, I'm gonna try and list them all. 

For arguments' sake, I tend to judge Kanken alternatives by some basic criteria:

* backpack with boxy shape
* tote-style top handles (often with snap closure) 
* sometimes with side pockets for water bottles, folding umbrellas, etc. 
* wide selection of colors
* sometimes has both a ""classic"" and ""mini"" version

These common features aside, the main selling points I see associated with the Kanken are its branding (the whole Swedish heritage thing), and environmentally-friendly marketing. If you set those two things (plus the Instagram reputation) aside, you'll find some more affordable, more functional, or (your mileage may vary) more interesting than the Kanken. Obviously if you want a nicer backpack that's *not* Kanken-esque, you can always go get a Herschel or Timbuk2 or something.

**A sidenote about [Himawari](https://www.himawaribags.com):** As far as I'm concerned, there are only two reasons to buy a Himawari bag:

1. If you can't afford an Anello or a Doughnut Macaroon

2. If you can't find a seller of either that ships to your area

I can't vouch for how sturdy they are long-term, but the way Himawari directly plagiarizes certain Anello/Doughnut designs to the letter is a bit offputting IMO. If you aren't really particular about branding though, it's worth a shot and just as functional. The Buttercup is pretty much a dead ringer for the Doughnut Macaroon, while the Holly, Cypress, Petunia, and Corey models are all variations on the classic Anello. 

-----

On a closing note, I personally own both an Anello and a Macaroon. The Anello's doctor's bag-style closure (the Pacsafe Citysafe CX uses it too) and the back zipper access are both nifty features. But tbh I'm a total Macaroon fangirl: waterproof fabric, sturdy construction, a *ton* of inner compartments. It's like the Kanken turned up to 11. If the regular model is too small for you though, I'd recommend sizing up to the large Cordura version (roughly 18L), though there aren't as many colors to choose from.

femalefashionadvice,patagonia,Pet hair proof clothing,"I've looked around past post on this topic, and most of them seem to focus on prevention/workarounds like lint roller, wearing same color as your pet, brushing your pet, having home-clothes, putting it in the dryer...etc.

But what are some specific clothing lines that seem to repel pet hair?

In my experience polyester/nylon in tight weave seems to work the best, while loose natural fibers seem to stick to hair the most (RIP cashmere, merino wool). Getting the weave right is the toughest part, especially online shopping. I try to zoom in to try to feel the material with my eyeball, but not as accurate as feeling it in person... which is why I'm looking for some help here!

Here's some examples from my wardrobe:

\- Perfect: [Patagonia nano puff](https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-nano-puff-jacket/84217.html) line: they have jackets and vests in this line. Very slick material, but not overly shiny. Pet hair does not stick to it, at ALL. Wish they made pants in this material.

\- Good: [Lululemon Stretch High Rise pants](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/womens-trousers/Stretch-High-Rise-78-Pant-MD/_/prod10520807?color=47824&sz=0): ""Luxstreme"" material, which seems to be Nylon/Lycra blend. This works pretty well. Hair can stick to it, but most of them falls off while I'm moving around. Some stubborn hair can get ""embedded"" in the fabric and needs to be pulled out... or a wash/dry also gets rid of most.

\- Bad: [Arcteryx Covert Cardigan](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/covert-cardigan): it's similar to the well-known Patagonia Better Sweater. Polyester, but the weave is a magnet for pet hair. Hair constantly embedded in between the fabric and difficult to keep clean even with religious lint rolling. The website did say it was fleece, but it is not one of those ""fuzzy"" cotton-candy-like fleece type and looks more like tightly woven wool....so I had had hope.",1672688061.0,"Pet hair proof clothing I've looked around past post on this topic, and most of them seem to focus on prevention/workarounds like lint roller, wearing same color as your pet, brushing your pet, having home-clothes, putting it in the dryer...etc.

i hear a lot about the a new day tshirts at target i found a nice 34 length patterned blouse there 6 years ago that still looks good and gets a lot of wear

ive also had a great time at old navy off and on 7 years ago i found a long sleeve wrap dress that i still wear frequently i have an 8 year old grey fleece that looks exactly like the patagonia ones that i wore daily for at least a year as well as seasonal wear up until now i took a hiatus from on for a while but went back last fall and found some great things last fall i bought a puffy vest that is quite warm and ill probably wear for years to come likewise there were some 34 length boat neck shirts that were fantastic last year that im sad they didnt bring back this season",Positive

femalefashionadvice,patagonia,100+ Ethical UK Fashion Brands (including colourful & affordable options),"[Crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalfashion/comments/o2pre7/100_uk_ethical_shops_including_colourful/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) from r/ethicalfashion (with some extra context here) as I thought it might be something that folks here are interested in.

I started moving towards slow fashion last summer, I've been aware of the problems with fast fashion for a while but ultimately seeing that lots of big companies weren't paying garment workers for finished products during the middle of a pandemic really pushed me to give ethical fashion brands another try.

Common complaints about slow fashion are that it's boxy, shapeless and beige. Or, that it's expensive. These were my complaints too. I was determined to find out whether this was actually the case and through a lot of research and lateral thinking, I've found over 100 places to shop for ethical clothing that meet my standards. 

There have been discussions on this sub about ethical fashion being boring and not worth the money. And having come out the other side of this journey, it's just not true, you just have to look a bit harder. 

**To note:**

My priorities are fair wages/labour practices then the environment. Most of these are UK-based, some are European which means they aren't all shipping here right now but will hopefully be able to in the future. Lots of places do ship internationally.

Some indie shops listed don't accept returns which I personally think is an unethical practice and also *illegal* when selling online in the UK but I know some customers don't care if it's a small business so I've included some indie brands I wouldn't personally shop at. 

Mostly women's clothes, cause that's what I wear.

**General**

- [Project CeCe](https://www.projectcece.co.uk/) - directory to find an item and it will show you which brands are selling it
- [Wearth London](https://www.wearthlondon.com/) - online department store 
- [Sancho's](https://sanchosshop.com/) - indie, black-owned business that stocks various brands
- [69b Boutique](https://69bboutique.com/) - indie shop that stocks various brands 
- [Marks and Spencer](https://www.marksandspencer.com/) - all rounder, affordable but aimed at middle-aged and up group. They're now selling other brands so watch out for the fast fashion high street brands. 
- [The Good Apparel](https://www.thegoodapparel.com/) (Europe) - sells different brands

**Disclaimer:** please do your own checks for ethics/sustainability. I usually look for clear pages on websites about sustainability, whether they show transparency on their factories, production line and workers and I often email smaller businesses to see where garments are made.

And to add, despite having all of these options, I still don't shop 100% ethically because these websites are still limited in scope. Ethical activewear brands in the UK don't offer high impact sports bras. I am not interested in bralettes so I won't be buying ethical underwear anytime soon. I'm allergic to wool and nothing fits the trio of cosy, affordable and doesn't irritate my skin better than acrylic so my jumpers are fast fashion. But at least I know I have lots of ethical options to look at first!

ETA: Forgot about Cosabella which actually does have supportive bras, so have added that! Have added a couple new brands and removed a couple according to comments.",1624027554.0,"100+ Ethical UK Fashion Brands (including colourful & affordable options) [Crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalfashion/comments/o2pre7/100_uk_ethical_shops_including_colourful/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) from r/ethicalfashion (with some extra context here) as I thought it might be something that folks here are interested in.

**Disclaimer:** please do your own checks for ethics/sustainability. I usually look for clear pages on websites about sustainability, whether they show transparency on their factories, production line and workers and I often email smaller businesses to see where garments are made.

And to add, despite having all of these options, I still don't shop 100% ethically because these websites are still limited in scope. Ethical activewear brands in the UK don't offer high impact sports bras. I am not interested in bralettes so I won't be buying ethical underwear anytime soon. I'm allergic to wool and nothing fits the trio of cosy, affordable and doesn't irritate my skin better than acrylic so my jumpers are fast fashion. But at least I know I have lots of ethical options to look at first!

ETA: Forgot about Cosabella which actually does have supportive bras, so have added that! Have added a couple new brands and removed a couple according to comments.","100 ethical uk fashion brands including colourful  affordable options crossposting from rethicalfashion with some extra context here as i thought it might be something that folks here are interested in

i started moving towards slow fashion last summer ive been aware of the problems with fast fashion for a while but ultimately seeing that lots of big companies werent paying garment workers for finished products during the middle of a pandemic really pushed me to give ethical fashion brands another try

common complaints about slow fashion are that its boxy shapeless and beige or that its expensive these were my complaints too i was determined to find out whether this was actually the case and through a lot of research and lateral thinking ive found over 100 places to shop for ethical clothing that meet my standards 

there have been discussions on this sub about ethical fashion being boring and not worth the money and having come out the other side of this journey its just not true you just have to look a bit harder 

to note

my priorities are fair wageslabour practices then the environment most of these are ukbased some are european which means they arent all shipping here right now but will hopefully be able to in the future lots of places do ship internationally

some indie shops listed dont accept returns which i personally think is an unethical practice and also illegal when selling online in the uk but i know some customers dont care if its a small business so ive included some indie brands i wouldnt personally shop at 

mostly womens clothes cause thats what i wear

general

 wearth london  online department store 
 sanchos  indie blackowned business that stocks various brands

It was so sweet and thoughtful, but also hilarious and potentially disastrous.

[Pinterest](https://pin.it/5BmghZY8m)

Sorry Google, farm clothes ain‚Äôt just Carhartt and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear your nice clothes on the farm.‚Äù

So, I made the album I wanted back when I moved to a farm: a farmer‚Äôs workwear album. The Western/Americana albums are great, but I always felt they lacked actual gritty, dirty, working women serving lewks while farming.

Ranch dressing (ha!), Western, Americana: it‚Äôs all here, made practical.

**Color Scheme:**¬†earth tones (hides the dirt) with pops of red and turquoise.

**Fabrics:**¬†sturdy + durable natural fabrics - cotton, denim, leather, linen, hemp, fleece. heavy fabrics - flannel, canvas. technical synthetic materials for sweat wicking. waterproof and waxed fabrics.

**Silhouettes:**¬†comfortable. relaxed, looser fit. layers.

**Styling Choices:**¬†heavy, durable clothes, in winter. linen in summer. sun + element protection - long sleeves, long pants. minimal jewelry, if any.

**Details:** western details - hats, snap shirts, bandanas/wild rags, belts with silver buckle. Embroidery. lots of pockets. reinforcing details - double knees, gusset. Patches. Jackets.

**Outfit ideas/specifics:** Most of the outfits follow a simple formula - jeans (or any pants) + button up, Belt + large buckle, neck bandana, Western boots, cowboy hat. Overalls + long sleeve t‚Äôs. Flowy collared dresses for farmer‚Äôs markets.

* DENIM (Jeans, jeans, + more jeans, shirts, trucker jackets)
* Outerwear (Chore coats, Field jackets, Anarok jackets)
* steel toed boots, insulated boots (a game changer in winter)

femalefashionadvice,patagonia,"Guide: Packing for Travel, a.k.a., I'm going to [PLACE] in [MONTH], what should I pack!?","This sub gets a lot of questions about packing for travel, and there is a ton of good advice to be found on the topic. This post is an attempt to gather it all together in one place. 

Since people travel to lots of different places for lots of different reasons, this guide will attempt to give you a **strategy** to employ when packing -- it won't tell you exactly which items to pack. And since this is FFA, not a travel subreddit, these tips are mostly for *clothing choices*, not for the *logistics* of packing (though I did include a small logistics section at the end). With the exception of more long-term travel (months at a time), this strategy should work well for a weekend with friends in New York City, a 10-day African safari, visiting family for the holidays, a romantic getaway in Paris, or a month exploring in India.

Packing is the art of choosing the most (1) **comfortable**, (2) **versatile** pieces in your wardrobe that are appropriate for the (3) **weather** at your destination and the (4) **activities** you'll be doing while there.

Addressing these out of order...


**ANSWER TWO MAIN QUESTIONS TO START**

**1: Weather?**

I always start with the weather: What kind of **shoes** will I need, and what kind of **jacket**, if any? 

You will be miserable if you only pack a denim jacket, and it's freezing your entire trip. You'll be similarly miserable if you only pack canvas shoes, and it rains the entire time. So, to ensure your clothes don't distract you from you enjoying your trip, your first step is to pick shoes and jackets that are appropriate for the weather forecast. 

Note: Although you can (and probably should) spend time before your trip thinking about what you might bring, you should wait until the day or two before you leave to actually pack, because the weather forecast changes all the time -- and it will probably change again once you arrive!

**2: Activities?**

The second most important thing to consider is what activities you'll be doing -- even a general idea is useful. Lots of walking? Sight-seeing in an urban metropolis? Visiting a beach? Anything sporty, like hiking or canoeing? Will you be spending time around animals, or on a farm? Mostly outside, or mostly inside? Clubbing, bar-hopping, or fancy dinners? Any modesty requirements for visits to a mosque, the Vatican, etc.? Any formal occasions to plan for?

Answering these questions will help you further narrow down your shoe and jacket choices. A week in London spent eating at Michelin-star restaurants will require very different shoes and jackets than a week spent traipsing through the jungle in Thailand.

**BUILD UPON YOUR CHOSEN SHOES AND JACKETS**

When it comes to choosing items from your closet to pack, let *color* and *proportion* guide you to the most **versatile** pieces you own that you know you'll be **comfortable** wearing.

**Color:** 

If you have a fairly cohesive color scheme in your wardrobe already, that makes it 10x easier to create a smaller capsule for traveling. Here is a guide to [color matching](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1pbmrj/a_guide_to_color_matching/) and one on [personal color analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2hjrhz/an_introduction_to_personal_color_analysis_aka/). 

* **Easy mode:** Bring all neutrals. Everything goes with everything. The easiest choices are [black, white, gray, and denim](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/79/46/73794629f7802109dc122307c39abf29.jpg).

* **Moderate difficulty:** Add one or two ""pop"" colors to your neutral bases. [A Pair and a Spare](http://apairandasparediy.com/2015/06/how-to-pack-the-5-4-3-2-1-guide/) has a [black/white/denim + army green](http://apairandasparediy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/18510052620_35de9bce57_o.png) example. This blog post from [Live Love Sarah](http://livelovesara.com/2017/02/what-to-wear-in-central-europe-outfit-options/) shows a [black/white/gray/denim + blush pink](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/95/fc/e4/95fce4915b9d6aa4694f50fb88ccfd72.jpg) example.

* **Hard mode:** Forget ""neutrals"" and pack what speaks to you. The Vivienne Files is a fantastic resource for [color capsules of all types](http://www.theviviennefiles.com/p/four-by-four-wardrobes.html).

**Proportion:** 

If color is the ""match"" part of a ""mix-and-match"" travel wardrobe, then proportion and silhouette are the ""mix"" part. Just because navy and mustard are complementary colors doesn't mean you can automatically make outfits with every single navy and mustard piece you have. You have to consider proportion and silhouette to make sure the tops and bottoms you choose interface well with each other. (If you've yet to take the time to identify what proportions you prefer and that work for your body, Into Mind has a great [proportions catalog](https://anuschkarees.com/blog/2013/08/25/proportions-catalogue) to peruse. FFA also has [this guide to proportion](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/).)

Identify one or two silhouettes you want to wear on your trip -- keeping in the mind the shoes and jackets you've already chosen -- and pack items that work well with each other. 

Here are some examples of pairs of silhouettes that contain at least one overlapping element:

* (1) [high-waisted bottoms + cropped-length tops](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/59/8d/2c/598d2c043826bffe5fe94816de4e54ff.jpg) and (2) [fit-and-flare dresses + cropped cardigans](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/312/18488432859_ec11770dce_z.jpg). The cropped cardigans work for both silhouettes: over the dresses, or with the high-waisted pants, maximizing your versatility.

* (1) [maxi skirt + fitted tops](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/38/30/4f/38304f676c4061d61b6699927e760242.jpg) and (2) [loose pants + fitted tops](http://stylishcurves.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4908-2-e1438565592970.jpg). Assuming you coordinate your colors well, all the tops you bring could be worn with all of the bottoms you bring.

* (1) [oversized tops + skinny jeans](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ec/07/b7/ec07b7697ea58b2fd6b74f13877d9f99.jpg) and (2) [mini skirts + oversized pullovers](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/87/e0/7387e0239d5851275f6273b0dd2b98f3.jpg). Again - you can wear the oversized tops with the pants or the skirts, giving you the ability to change up your look and your silhouette with some of the same pieces.

**On comfort:**

Don't try brand-new pieces or new combinations on a trip. If you don't wear it at home, you're unlikely to want to wear it while traveling. And if you don't have experience wearing a piece, you won't know its quirks -- maybe it takes forever to dry, shows water spots, rides up when you walk, wrinkles in a heartbeat, or stinks a lot if you sweat, etc. **Aim to pack things you already wear often.** You know you like them. You know they fit. You know they look good with X shoes or Y jacket. You feel comfortable in them. You feel confident wearing them. These are all important points! You want to enjoy your trip, not spend all of your time feeling uncomfortable in your clothes.

So, based on those four main considerations (weather, activities, versatility, and comfort) you can essentially work yourself through a flow chart of your own closet. Below, I've given two examples of working my way through this strategy when packing for two different types of trips.

**EXAMPLE PACKING EXPERIENCE 1**

4-day trip to visit friends and their new baby in San Francisco in January:

1. What's the weather? Mid-50s F, sunny, no rain forecasted. Great! In that case, I think I'll bring my leather jacket, and I have my choice of shoes since there's no rain. I always walk a lot while I'm in SF, though, so we'll keep comfort in mind. I put insoles in my VANS and find them very comfortable for all-day walking, and since there's no rain the forecast, I should be fine in canvas shoes. I'll probably bring those and my clogs, which are also very comfortable for lots of walking.

2. Since I'm bringing my leather jacket, all of my chunky sweaters are out, because they won't fit under it. So, I'll pick out a couple of thin sweaters and top layers that I know wear well under my leather jacket. 

3. Once I've picked the jacket and a couple of sweaters, I choose some first layers (t-shirts, button-ups, blouses, whatever) that match. I can also start choosing bottoms at this point: for me, it's pants/jeans, because I'm not really a skirt person, especially in cooler temperatures. Remember to keep asking yourself, ""What activities will I be doing?"" I know on this trip, I'll be hanging out at my friends' house with them and their baby, so I don't want to pack fussy fabrics or fancy items like silk or cashmere, because babies can be messy. 

4. At this point, it's useful to start thinking about color. My main neutrals are navy and denim, and most of the other colors in my wardrobe go with those -- and with each other (gray, cream, burgundy, mustard, burnt orange, olive green) -- so it's pretty easy for me to pick some navy/denim bottoms, any combination of tops I like, and go.

5. Now, I consider proportion to make sure the tops and bottoms I chose interface well with each other. Personally, my silhouette of choice is high-waisted bottoms + loose, cropped-length or tucked-in tops. So, I might pack high-waisted dark denim, some tops in cream and gray (mostly fitted that I will wear tucked in since the temperature will be cool), a cropped burnt orange sweater, and a regular navy blue sweater, knowing that I can ""mix and match"" all of it.

**EXAMPLE PACKING EXPERIENCE 2**

8-day trip to Cuba to climb and explore in March: 

1. What's the weather? 80s and 90s F, sunny, but the possibility of rain. So, I'm definitely bringing my Chacos, because those are perfect ""hot + wet"" shoes, especially in a developing country where I won't always be in big cities. I'll probably also bring Birkenstocks for dry days and a slightly more polished look. Jackets? Just my lightweight rain jacket should do.

2. Activities? I'm planning to sightsee and go rock climbing. So, I'm bringing a pair of climbing pants that I can also wear for hiking or horseback riding, etc. Then I add 2 tank tops to climb in, my favorite pair of high-waisted denim shorts, and another tank and tee to wear when I'm not climbing. Two of the four tops I'm bringing are linen, because... hot. The other two are merino wool because they won't start stinking immediately after I sweat in them, and I can wash/dry them quickly if/when they do.

3. It's Cuba and it'll be hot, so I'm bringing a swim suit, because you never know. I'll also pack a casual tank dress that I can wear with the Birks for a nicer dinner look, or as a coverup for any potential beach trips. 

4. Color check: The pants are gray, and the shorts are denim. All of the tops are rusty orange, cream, and gray. The tank dress is navy blue. Looks like I'm good to go! I'll probably also pack my orange and gray flannel for any chilly moments (and the plane). [This is basically my color scheme.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b3/85/12/b3851225ec78f5bc605461f3960e4f7e.jpg)

5. Proportion check: Pants, shorts, and tees are combos I wear often in the summer. As a bonus, I'm bringing one cropped tee, and I can wear it over the tank dress to create a skirt look -- [a la](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/30/00/38/3000387a854a77134c47878bc513028d.jpg) -- if I want.

**FLESH OUT YOUR OUTFITS**

One important step is to actually build outfits with the items you've chosen before you pack them for good. Lay everything out on your bed to see how the colors look together. Try on outfits to make sure you actually can wear that jacket with that dress, or those shoes with those pants, and that it works -- that you like how it looks.

This is also the time to see how many combinations you can make with the items you've chosen. Can you wear most of your tops with all of your bottoms? What about first and second top layers (sweaters/cardigans over tanks/tees) -- are they flexible and interchangeable? Have you chosen any items that can only be worn with *one* other thing? If so, unless it's for a specific occasion, perhaps reconsider bringing it.

**IN SUMMARY**

1. Start by asking yourself what the weather will be, and what kinds of activities you'll be doing. Choose some shoes and jackets based on the answers to those questions.

2. Use your shoe/jacket picks to help you narrow down your clothing choices, always asking yourself if your choices are appropriate for the weather and your activities.

3. Consider color, proportion, and silhouette to ensure you can mix and match most of what you bring.

4. Bring comfortable, trusted pieces that you're familiar with and already wear often.

**OTHER GENERAL TIPS:**

* **Bring your favorites!** If you have that one sweater you find yourself wearing 2x or 3x per week, pack it! With your limited travel wardrobe, you won't mind wearing that sweater a lot because... you already do.

* Yes, you can **repeat** outfits and **re-wear** items several times. No one will notice. No one will care. Carry a stain remover pen to remove small marks.

* **Scarves and jewelry** can add interest, variety, and formality without taking up much space.

* **Scarves**: use them... (1) as a scarf, (2) as a blanket, (3) as a pillow, (4) as a head covering in conservative or religious countries and settings, (5) as a towel (in a pinch), (6) as a make-shift satchel (hobo-style), (7) as a privacy curtain, or (8) as a skirt (if it's big enough).

* I never recommend traveling with **white** pants, skirts, or dresses -- too much can go wrong.

* In general, I like to travel with **unfussy pieces and fabrics**. Things that won't wrinkle easily. Things that are easy to wash. 

* Consider **wool**: It's lightweight, it dries quickly, it doesn't hold smells, and you can confidently re-wear wool items more times than other fabrics. There are several companies that make high-quality merino wool clothing items that are great for traveling: [Smartwool](http://www.smartwool.com/), [Ibex](http://shop.ibex.com/), and [Icebreaker](http://www.icebreaker.com/en/home) are my favorites.

* For a one-off **formal occasion**, a dress or skirt can get you far: ""dress it up"" or ""dress it down"" with a change of your shoes, jewelry, jacket, and/or hair: [a jersey dress](http://www.athoughtfulplaceblog.com/dressed-up-or-dressed-down/), or [a jumpsuit](https://d2klylognp0re.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BLG_boutique_support_tart.jpg), or [a lace skirt](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9pHKQfBGuDE/VRl463g3hRI/AAAAAAAAQ-8/Z1cHQXvU6zE/s1600/lace%2Bskirt%2Bdressed%2Bup%2Bdressed%2Bdown.png).

* If **space** is at a premium, bring old socks and underwear and throw them away before you come home. 

* Don't forget **pajamas** -- if you're staying in someone else's home, a hostel, or anywhere else that's not completely private, you'll want a top & bottom you can wear around other people at night. Leggings or joggers + tee, for example. Bonus if either piece is one you can also wear as part of an outfit if you need to.

* I always bring a pair of **cheap rubber flip flops**, no matter my destination. For shower shoes, for wearing around the house / hotel / hostel, to the beach, to the pool -- you never know how they might come in handy.

* If it's a longer trip, consider if you'll be able to do **laundry**. If you can, maybe you can get away with packing a bit less and wearing a smaller number of items more often. 

* **Warm weather tips:** Maxi skirts, maxi dresses, and joggers are great for full coverage that won't make you overheat. Fabric suggestions include linen (though prone to wrinkles) and [wool](http://www.merino.com/wool/the-fibre/5-ways-to-beat-the-heat/). A [linen or chambray button-down](http://www.bodenimages.com/productimages/productLarge/17WSPR_WA785_LAV_W01.jpg) is a great top layer for summer travel. Wear it alone, over a tee, or [tied over a dress](http://brightontheday.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brighton-4-740x1110.jpg).

* **Cold weather tips:** Layers. Wool. Wool socks. Silk long underwear. Uniqlo [Heattech](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech-collection). Lightweight, [packable down jackets](http://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-down-sweater-jacket/84683.html?dwvar_84683_color=BSRB&cgid=womens-jackets-vests-insulated#tile-2=&prefn1=features&prefv1=packable&start=1&sz=24).

**ON FITTING IN / BLENDING WITH LOCALS / NOT LOOKING LIKE A TOURIST**

Some people feel strongly about fitting in with the local style when they travel. If you want to take the opportunity of traveling to a new place to explore a new style, obviously that's fine, but it's usually not *necessary* to worry too much about it -- unless it's a modesty issue for cultural or religious regions. For example: If you're visiting Muslim countries, mosques, temples, the Vatican, or other religious sites or places of worship, you should be aware of and sensitive to the accepted dress out of respect. On the other hand, if you're visiting Stockholm from the U.S., for example, and are just worried about looking ""too American,"" you can probably relax a bit. Millions of people visit Stockholm every year -- its residents are used to tourists and are unlikely to treat you differently no matter if you're wearing an LLBean fleece and [Asics](http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/4/3/6/3/1/7/webimg/571940554_o.jpg) or the latest in Scandinavian minimalism or street style. Do not act obnoxiously or be disrespectful, and you'll be fine.

**ON THE LOGISTICS OF PACKING (esp. for air travel)**

Traveling with a carry-on instead of checking luggage has become the ""cool"" thing to do recently, and there are good reasons to buy into the practice: 

* Many (most?) airlines now charge extra fees for even a single checked bag, so you can save some money by carrying everything on the plane. 

* You can avoid the possibility of lost or delayed luggage by keeping everything with you. 

* You can adapt to last-minute changes in your travel plans (unexpected layover, forced plane change, rerouting, etc.) without worrying about ending up in a different place than your belongings.

* It's easier to physically manage smaller luggage than large suitcases (and maneuver through crowded spaces, onto escalators and trains).

* From a fashion and outfit-building perspective, bringing a smaller number of clothes makes getting dressed easier and faster because you have fewer decisions to make. That means you spend more time enjoying your trip, and less time in your hotel room, deciding what to wear.

Here are some **general tips for packing and traveling light:**

* It helps if your suitcase itself doesn't weigh very much. Every airline has weight restrictions for carry-on items, so be aware of them.

* It's a universal truth that you will completely fill whatever size bag(s) you choose to bring. Pick a smaller bag, and you'll pack less. Pick a bigger bag, and you'll surely pack more.

* [Roll, don't fold.](http://herpackinglist.com/2013/09/rolling-vs-folding/)

* Experiment with [bundle packing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ZrYtRjYfs). Here's a related [""superpack""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtCH6KLdfBs) strategy for just one overnight.

* Using packing cubes reduces wrinkles and keeps your suitcase from being an explosion of fabric and stuff every time you open it: [Eagle Creek](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packing-cubes/l/212) and [eBags](https://www.amazon.com/eBags-Packing-Cubes-3pc-Set/dp/B004C0XZM4) are two popular brands.

* Tuck socks and underwear inside your shoes to maximize space *and* help your shoes keep their shape.

* Use [re-useable shoe bags](https://www.amazon.com/Richards-Homewares-Travel-Shoe-Bag/dp/B000A68EAW) (or use plastic grocery bags) to keep the dirty soles of your shoes off the rest of your clothes. You can also use plastic shower caps to just cover the soles -- I see that tip a lot, but I'm way more likely to have plastic bags than I am to have 4 or 6 plastic shower caps lying around.

* Here are some [tips for packing toiletries](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/01/packing-tips-toiletry-bag_n_6554404.html).

* Consider the orientation of your luggage most of the time. If you have a traditional [rolling carry-on](http://gogreentravelgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/travelers-choice-hardside-rolling-carryon.jpg), arrange heavy things (shoes, toiletries, appliances) so they'll sit at the bottom (at the wheels) when you close the suitcase and stand it upright. That way, heavy things don't put pressure on your clothing items, potentially wrinkling them. It's also easier to pull and steer a rolling suitcase when heavy things are closest to the wheels. In a backpack, weight is best/easiest carried as close to your back as possible, and not too high. One caveat to this: Some airports still require you to actually remove the bag containing your 3-oz.-or-less liquids when you go through security (LHR, for one). You don't want them to be too difficult to get to if that's the case.

* Wear your bulkiest clothing and shoes on the plane (if it makes sense for the weather).

* Almost everywhere will you go will have almost everything you might need. If space is really at a premium, don't bring things ""just in case"" -- for ex., bug spray, umbrella -- you can always buy them in a pinch.

* If you anticipate coming home with significantly more than you brought, bring a [packable duffle](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packable-duffel/d/1399) that can expand to swallow souvenirs and gifts (make sure to attach a luggage tag with your phone number and email address if you plan to check it).

Whew! This guide got really long, but I hope it was still palatable and useful. I'm very open to feedback and am happy to make edits or additions, so please speak up if you have ideas! 

Also, I know I didn't include anything about **business travel / travel for work**. I don't really have any experience with packing suits and other business-casual or business-formal pieces. If someone wants to type up a section on that, I'll be very happy to add it in with credit to you!

Edit: Thank you so much for the gold, kind stranger! My first Reddit gold! :)",1488461833.0,"Guide: Packing for Travel, a.k.a., I'm going to [PLACE] in [MONTH], what should I pack!? This sub gets a lot of questions about packing for travel, and there is a ton of good advice to be found on the topic. This post is an attempt to gather it all together in one place. 

Since people travel to lots of different places for lots of different reasons, this guide will attempt to give you a **strategy** to employ when packing -- it won't tell you exactly which items to pack. And since this is FFA, not a travel subreddit, these tips are mostly for *clothing choices*, not for the *logistics* of packing (though I did include a small logistics section at the end). With the exception of more long-term travel (months at a time), this strategy should work well for a weekend with friends in New York City, a 10-day African safari, visiting family for the holidays, a romantic getaway in Paris, or a month exploring in India.

Packing is the art of choosing the most (1) **comfortable**, (2) **versatile** pieces in your wardrobe that are appropriate for the (3) **weather** at your destination and the (4) **activities** you'll be doing while there.

Addressing these out of order...


**ANSWER TWO MAIN QUESTIONS TO START**

**1: Weather?**

I always start with the weather: What kind of **shoes** will I need, and what kind of **jacket**, if any? 

You will be miserable if you only pack a denim jacket, and it's freezing your entire trip. You'll be similarly miserable if you only pack canvas shoes, and it rains the entire time. So, to ensure your clothes don't distract you from you enjoying your trip, your first step is to pick shoes and jackets that are appropriate for the weather forecast. 

Note: Although you can (and probably should) spend time before your trip thinking about what you might bring, you should wait until the day or two before you leave to actually pack, because the weather forecast changes all the time -- and it will probably change again once you arrive!

**2: Activities?**

The second most important thing to consider is what activities you'll be doing -- even a general idea is useful. Lots of walking? Sight-seeing in an urban metropolis? Visiting a beach? Anything sporty, like hiking or canoeing? Will you be spending time around animals, or on a farm? Mostly outside, or mostly inside? Clubbing, bar-hopping, or fancy dinners? Any modesty requirements for visits to a mosque, the Vatican, etc.? Any formal occasions to plan for?

Answering these questions will help you further narrow down your shoe and jacket choices. A week in London spent eating at Michelin-star restaurants will require very different shoes and jackets than a week spent traipsing through the jungle in Thailand.

**BUILD UPON YOUR CHOSEN SHOES AND JACKETS**

When it comes to choosing items from your closet to pack, let *color* and *proportion* guide you to the most **versatile** pieces you own that you know you'll be **comfortable** wearing.

**Color:** 

If you have a fairly cohesive color scheme in your wardrobe already, that makes it 10x easier to create a smaller capsule for traveling. Here is a guide to [color matching](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1pbmrj/a_guide_to_color_matching/) and one on [personal color analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2hjrhz/an_introduction_to_personal_color_analysis_aka/). 

* **Easy mode:** Bring all neutrals. Everything goes with everything. The easiest choices are [black, white, gray, and denim](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/79/46/73794629f7802109dc122307c39abf29.jpg).

* **Moderate difficulty:** Add one or two ""pop"" colors to your neutral bases. [A Pair and a Spare](http://apairandasparediy.com/2015/06/how-to-pack-the-5-4-3-2-1-guide/) has a [black/white/denim + army green](http://apairandasparediy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/18510052620_35de9bce57_o.png) example. This blog post from [Live Love Sarah](http://livelovesara.com/2017/02/what-to-wear-in-central-europe-outfit-options/) shows a [black/white/gray/denim + blush pink](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/95/fc/e4/95fce4915b9d6aa4694f50fb88ccfd72.jpg) example.

* **Hard mode:** Forget ""neutrals"" and pack what speaks to you. The Vivienne Files is a fantastic resource for [color capsules of all types](http://www.theviviennefiles.com/p/four-by-four-wardrobes.html).

**Proportion:** 

If color is the ""match"" part of a ""mix-and-match"" travel wardrobe, then proportion and silhouette are the ""mix"" part. Just because navy and mustard are complementary colors doesn't mean you can automatically make outfits with every single navy and mustard piece you have. You have to consider proportion and silhouette to make sure the tops and bottoms you choose interface well with each other. (If you've yet to take the time to identify what proportions you prefer and that work for your body, Into Mind has a great [proportions catalog](https://anuschkarees.com/blog/2013/08/25/proportions-catalogue) to peruse. FFA also has [this guide to proportion](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/).)

Identify one or two silhouettes you want to wear on your trip -- keeping in the mind the shoes and jackets you've already chosen -- and pack items that work well with each other. 

Here are some examples of pairs of silhouettes that contain at least one overlapping element:

* (1) [high-waisted bottoms + cropped-length tops](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/59/8d/2c/598d2c043826bffe5fe94816de4e54ff.jpg) and (2) [fit-and-flare dresses + cropped cardigans](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/312/18488432859_ec11770dce_z.jpg). The cropped cardigans work for both silhouettes: over the dresses, or with the high-waisted pants, maximizing your versatility.

* (1) [maxi skirt + fitted tops](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/38/30/4f/38304f676c4061d61b6699927e760242.jpg) and (2) [loose pants + fitted tops](http://stylishcurves.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4908-2-e1438565592970.jpg). Assuming you coordinate your colors well, all the tops you bring could be worn with all of the bottoms you bring.

* (1) [oversized tops + skinny jeans](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ec/07/b7/ec07b7697ea58b2fd6b74f13877d9f99.jpg) and (2) [mini skirts + oversized pullovers](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/87/e0/7387e0239d5851275f6273b0dd2b98f3.jpg). Again - you can wear the oversized tops with the pants or the skirts, giving you the ability to change up your look and your silhouette with some of the same pieces.

**On comfort:**

Don't try brand-new pieces or new combinations on a trip. If you don't wear it at home, you're unlikely to want to wear it while traveling. And if you don't have experience wearing a piece, you won't know its quirks -- maybe it takes forever to dry, shows water spots, rides up when you walk, wrinkles in a heartbeat, or stinks a lot if you sweat, etc. **Aim to pack things you already wear often.** You know you like them. You know they fit. You know they look good with X shoes or Y jacket. You feel comfortable in them. You feel confident wearing them. These are all important points! You want to enjoy your trip, not spend all of your time feeling uncomfortable in your clothes.

So, based on those four main considerations (weather, activities, versatility, and comfort) you can essentially work yourself through a flow chart of your own closet. Below, I've given two examples of working my way through this strategy when packing for two different types of trips.

**EXAMPLE PACKING EXPERIENCE 1**

4-day trip to visit friends and their new baby in San Francisco in January:

1. What's the weather? Mid-50s F, sunny, no rain forecasted. Great! In that case, I think I'll bring my leather jacket, and I have my choice of shoes since there's no rain. I always walk a lot while I'm in SF, though, so we'll keep comfort in mind. I put insoles in my VANS and find them very comfortable for all-day walking, and since there's no rain the forecast, I should be fine in canvas shoes. I'll probably bring those and my clogs, which are also very comfortable for lots of walking.

2. Since I'm bringing my leather jacket, all of my chunky sweaters are out, because they won't fit under it. So, I'll pick out a couple of thin sweaters and top layers that I know wear well under my leather jacket. 

3. Once I've picked the jacket and a couple of sweaters, I choose some first layers (t-shirts, button-ups, blouses, whatever) that match. I can also start choosing bottoms at this point: for me, it's pants/jeans, because I'm not really a skirt person, especially in cooler temperatures. Remember to keep asking yourself, ""What activities will I be doing?"" I know on this trip, I'll be hanging out at my friends' house with them and their baby, so I don't want to pack fussy fabrics or fancy items like silk or cashmere, because babies can be messy. 

4. At this point, it's useful to start thinking about color. My main neutrals are navy and denim, and most of the other colors in my wardrobe go with those -- and with each other (gray, cream, burgundy, mustard, burnt orange, olive green) -- so it's pretty easy for me to pick some navy/denim bottoms, any combination of tops I like, and go.

5. Now, I consider proportion to make sure the tops and bottoms I chose interface well with each other. Personally, my silhouette of choice is high-waisted bottoms + loose, cropped-length or tucked-in tops. So, I might pack high-waisted dark denim, some tops in cream and gray (mostly fitted that I will wear tucked in since the temperature will be cool), a cropped burnt orange sweater, and a regular navy blue sweater, knowing that I can ""mix and match"" all of it.

**EXAMPLE PACKING EXPERIENCE 2**

8-day trip to Cuba to climb and explore in March: 

1. What's the weather? 80s and 90s F, sunny, but the possibility of rain. So, I'm definitely bringing my Chacos, because those are perfect ""hot + wet"" shoes, especially in a developing country where I won't always be in big cities. I'll probably also bring Birkenstocks for dry days and a slightly more polished look. Jackets? Just my lightweight rain jacket should do.

2. Activities? I'm planning to sightsee and go rock climbing. So, I'm bringing a pair of climbing pants that I can also wear for hiking or horseback riding, etc. Then I add 2 tank tops to climb in, my favorite pair of high-waisted denim shorts, and another tank and tee to wear when I'm not climbing. Two of the four tops I'm bringing are linen, because... hot. The other two are merino wool because they won't start stinking immediately after I sweat in them, and I can wash/dry them quickly if/when they do.

3. It's Cuba and it'll be hot, so I'm bringing a swim suit, because you never know. I'll also pack a casual tank dress that I can wear with the Birks for a nicer dinner look, or as a coverup for any potential beach trips. 

4. Color check: The pants are gray, and the shorts are denim. All of the tops are rusty orange, cream, and gray. The tank dress is navy blue. Looks like I'm good to go! I'll probably also pack my orange and gray flannel for any chilly moments (and the plane). [This is basically my color scheme.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b3/85/12/b3851225ec78f5bc605461f3960e4f7e.jpg)

5. Proportion check: Pants, shorts, and tees are combos I wear often in the summer. As a bonus, I'm bringing one cropped tee, and I can wear it over the tank dress to create a skirt look -- [a la](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/30/00/38/3000387a854a77134c47878bc513028d.jpg) -- if I want.

**FLESH OUT YOUR OUTFITS**

One important step is to actually build outfits with the items you've chosen before you pack them for good. Lay everything out on your bed to see how the colors look together. Try on outfits to make sure you actually can wear that jacket with that dress, or those shoes with those pants, and that it works -- that you like how it looks.

This is also the time to see how many combinations you can make with the items you've chosen. Can you wear most of your tops with all of your bottoms? What about first and second top layers (sweaters/cardigans over tanks/tees) -- are they flexible and interchangeable? Have you chosen any items that can only be worn with *one* other thing? If so, unless it's for a specific occasion, perhaps reconsider bringing it.

**IN SUMMARY**

1. Start by asking yourself what the weather will be, and what kinds of activities you'll be doing. Choose some shoes and jackets based on the answers to those questions.

2. Use your shoe/jacket picks to help you narrow down your clothing choices, always asking yourself if your choices are appropriate for the weather and your activities.

3. Consider color, proportion, and silhouette to ensure you can mix and match most of what you bring.

4. Bring comfortable, trusted pieces that you're familiar with and already wear often.

**OTHER GENERAL TIPS:**

* **Bring your favorites!** If you have that one sweater you find yourself wearing 2x or 3x per week, pack it! With your limited travel wardrobe, you won't mind wearing that sweater a lot because... you already do.

* Yes, you can **repeat** outfits and **re-wear** items several times. No one will notice. No one will care. Carry a stain remover pen to remove small marks.

* **Scarves and jewelry** can add interest, variety, and formality without taking up much space.

* **Scarves**: use them... (1) as a scarf, (2) as a blanket, (3) as a pillow, (4) as a head covering in conservative or religious countries and settings, (5) as a towel (in a pinch), (6) as a make-shift satchel (hobo-style), (7) as a privacy curtain, or (8) as a skirt (if it's big enough).

* I never recommend traveling with **white** pants, skirts, or dresses -- too much can go wrong.

* In general, I like to travel with **unfussy pieces and fabrics**. Things that won't wrinkle easily. Things that are easy to wash. 

* Consider **wool**: It's lightweight, it dries quickly, it doesn't hold smells, and you can confidently re-wear wool items more times than other fabrics. There are several companies that make high-quality merino wool clothing items that are great for traveling: [Smartwool](http://www.smartwool.com/), [Ibex](http://shop.ibex.com/), and [Icebreaker](http://www.icebreaker.com/en/home) are my favorites.

* For a one-off **formal occasion**, a dress or skirt can get you far: ""dress it up"" or ""dress it down"" with a change of your shoes, jewelry, jacket, and/or hair: [a jersey dress](http://www.athoughtfulplaceblog.com/dressed-up-or-dressed-down/), or [a jumpsuit](https://d2klylognp0re.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BLG_boutique_support_tart.jpg), or [a lace skirt](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9pHKQfBGuDE/VRl463g3hRI/AAAAAAAAQ-8/Z1cHQXvU6zE/s1600/lace%2Bskirt%2Bdressed%2Bup%2Bdressed%2Bdown.png).

* If **space** is at a premium, bring old socks and underwear and throw them away before you come home. 

* Don't forget **pajamas** -- if you're staying in someone else's home, a hostel, or anywhere else that's not completely private, you'll want a top & bottom you can wear around other people at night. Leggings or joggers + tee, for example. Bonus if either piece is one you can also wear as part of an outfit if you need to.

* I always bring a pair of **cheap rubber flip flops**, no matter my destination. For shower shoes, for wearing around the house / hotel / hostel, to the beach, to the pool -- you never know how they might come in handy.

* If it's a longer trip, consider if you'll be able to do **laundry**. If you can, maybe you can get away with packing a bit less and wearing a smaller number of items more often. 

* **Warm weather tips:** Maxi skirts, maxi dresses, and joggers are great for full coverage that won't make you overheat. Fabric suggestions include linen (though prone to wrinkles) and [wool](http://www.merino.com/wool/the-fibre/5-ways-to-beat-the-heat/). A [linen or chambray button-down](http://www.bodenimages.com/productimages/productLarge/17WSPR_WA785_LAV_W01.jpg) is a great top layer for summer travel. Wear it alone, over a tee, or [tied over a dress](http://brightontheday.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brighton-4-740x1110.jpg).

* **Cold weather tips:** Layers. Wool. Wool socks. Silk long underwear. Uniqlo [Heattech](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech-collection). Lightweight, [packable down jackets](http://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-down-sweater-jacket/84683.html?dwvar_84683_color=BSRB&cgid=womens-jackets-vests-insulated#tile-2=&prefn1=features&prefv1=packable&start=1&sz=24).

**ON FITTING IN / BLENDING WITH LOCALS / NOT LOOKING LIKE A TOURIST**

Some people feel strongly about fitting in with the local style when they travel. If you want to take the opportunity of traveling to a new place to explore a new style, obviously that's fine, but it's usually not *necessary* to worry too much about it -- unless it's a modesty issue for cultural or religious regions. For example: If you're visiting Muslim countries, mosques, temples, the Vatican, or other religious sites or places of worship, you should be aware of and sensitive to the accepted dress out of respect. On the other hand, if you're visiting Stockholm from the U.S., for example, and are just worried about looking ""too American,"" you can probably relax a bit. Millions of people visit Stockholm every year -- its residents are used to tourists and are unlikely to treat you differently no matter if you're wearing an LLBean fleece and [Asics](http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/4/3/6/3/1/7/webimg/571940554_o.jpg) or the latest in Scandinavian minimalism or street style. Do not act obnoxiously or be disrespectful, and you'll be fine.

**ON THE LOGISTICS OF PACKING (esp. for air travel)**

Traveling with a carry-on instead of checking luggage has become the ""cool"" thing to do recently, and there are good reasons to buy into the practice: 

* Many (most?) airlines now charge extra fees for even a single checked bag, so you can save some money by carrying everything on the plane. 

* You can avoid the possibility of lost or delayed luggage by keeping everything with you. 

* You can adapt to last-minute changes in your travel plans (unexpected layover, forced plane change, rerouting, etc.) without worrying about ending up in a different place than your belongings.

* It's easier to physically manage smaller luggage than large suitcases (and maneuver through crowded spaces, onto escalators and trains).

* From a fashion and outfit-building perspective, bringing a smaller number of clothes makes getting dressed easier and faster because you have fewer decisions to make. That means you spend more time enjoying your trip, and less time in your hotel room, deciding what to wear.

Here are some **general tips for packing and traveling light:**

* It helps if your suitcase itself doesn't weigh very much. Every airline has weight restrictions for carry-on items, so be aware of them.

* It's a universal truth that you will completely fill whatever size bag(s) you choose to bring. Pick a smaller bag, and you'll pack less. Pick a bigger bag, and you'll surely pack more.

* [Roll, don't fold.](http://herpackinglist.com/2013/09/rolling-vs-folding/)

* Experiment with [bundle packing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ZrYtRjYfs). Here's a related [""superpack""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtCH6KLdfBs) strategy for just one overnight.

* Using packing cubes reduces wrinkles and keeps your suitcase from being an explosion of fabric and stuff every time you open it: [Eagle Creek](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packing-cubes/l/212) and [eBags](https://www.amazon.com/eBags-Packing-Cubes-3pc-Set/dp/B004C0XZM4) are two popular brands.

* Tuck socks and underwear inside your shoes to maximize space *and* help your shoes keep their shape.

* Use [re-useable shoe bags](https://www.amazon.com/Richards-Homewares-Travel-Shoe-Bag/dp/B000A68EAW) (or use plastic grocery bags) to keep the dirty soles of your shoes off the rest of your clothes. You can also use plastic shower caps to just cover the soles -- I see that tip a lot, but I'm way more likely to have plastic bags than I am to have 4 or 6 plastic shower caps lying around.

* Here are some [tips for packing toiletries](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/01/packing-tips-toiletry-bag_n_6554404.html).

* Consider the orientation of your luggage most of the time. If you have a traditional [rolling carry-on](http://gogreentravelgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/travelers-choice-hardside-rolling-carryon.jpg), arrange heavy things (shoes, toiletries, appliances) so they'll sit at the bottom (at the wheels) when you close the suitcase and stand it upright. That way, heavy things don't put pressure on your clothing items, potentially wrinkling them. It's also easier to pull and steer a rolling suitcase when heavy things are closest to the wheels. In a backpack, weight is best/easiest carried as close to your back as possible, and not too high. One caveat to this: Some airports still require you to actually remove the bag containing your 3-oz.-or-less liquids when you go through security (LHR, for one). You don't want them to be too difficult to get to if that's the case.

* Wear your bulkiest clothing and shoes on the plane (if it makes sense for the weather).

* Almost everywhere will you go will have almost everything you might need. If space is really at a premium, don't bring things ""just in case"" -- for ex., bug spray, umbrella -- you can always buy them in a pinch.

* If you anticipate coming home with significantly more than you brought, bring a [packable duffle](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packable-duffel/d/1399) that can expand to swallow souvenirs and gifts (make sure to attach a luggage tag with your phone number and email address if you plan to check it).

Whew! This guide got really long, but I hope it was still palatable and useful. I'm very open to feedback and am happy to make edits or additions, so please speak up if you have ideas! 

Also, I know I didn't include anything about **business travel / travel for work**. I don't really have any experience with packing suits and other business-casual or business-formal pieces. If someone wants to type up a section on that, I'll be very happy to add it in with credit to you!

Edit: Thank you so much for the gold, kind stranger! My first Reddit gold! :)","guide packing for travel aka im going to place in month what should i pack this sub gets a lot of questions about packing for travel and there is a ton of good advice to be found on the topic this post is an attempt to gather it all together in one place 

since people travel to lots of different places for lots of different reasons this guide will attempt to give you a strategy to employ when packing  it wont tell you exactly which items to pack and since this is ffa not a travel subreddit these tips are mostly for clothing choices not for the logistics of packing though i did include a small logistics section at the end with the exception of more longterm travel months at a time this strategy should work well for a weekend with friends in new york city a 10day african safari visiting family for the holidays a romantic getaway in paris or a month exploring in india

packing is the art of choosing the most 1 comfortable 2 versatile pieces in your wardrobe that are appropriate for the 3 weather at your destination and the 4 activities youll be doing while there

addressing these out of order


answer two main questions to start

1 weather

i always start with the weather what kind of shoes will i need and what kind of jacket if any 

you will be miserable if you only pack a denim jacket and its freezing your entire trip youll be similarly miserable if you only pack canvas shoes and it rains the entire time so to ensure your clothes dont distract you from you enjoying your trip your first step is to pick shoes and jackets that are appropriate for the weather forecast 

note although you can and probably should spend time before your trip thinking about what you might bring you should wait until the day or two before you leave to actually pack because the weather forecast changes all the time  and it will probably change again once you arrive

2 activities

the second most important thing to consider is what activities youll be doing  even a general idea is useful lots of walking sightseeing in an urban metropolis visiting a beach anything sporty like hiking or canoeing will you be spending time around animals or on a farm mostly outside or mostly inside clubbing barhopping or fancy dinners any modesty requirements for visits to a mosque the vatican etc any formal occasions to plan for

answering these questions will help you further narrow down your shoe and jacket choices a week in london spent eating at michelinstar restaurants will require very different shoes and jackets than a week spent traipsing through the jungle in thailand

build upon your chosen shoes and jackets

when it comes to choosing items from your closet to pack let color and proportion guide you to the most versatile pieces you own that you know youll be comfortable wearing

color 

if you have a fairly cohesive color scheme in your wardrobe already that makes it 10x easier to create a smaller capsule for traveling here is a guide to color matching and one on personal color analysis 

 easy mode bring all neutrals everything goes with everything the easiest choices are black white gray and denim

 moderate difficulty add one or two pop colors to your neutral bases a pair and a spare has a blackwhitedenim  army green example this blog post from live love sarah shows a blackwhitegraydenim  blush pink example

 hard mode forget neutrals and pack what speaks to you the vivienne files is a fantastic resource for color capsules of all types

proportion 

if color is the match part of a mixandmatch travel wardrobe then proportion and silhouette are the mix part just because navy and mustard are complementary colors doesnt mean you can automatically make outfits with every single navy and mustard piece you have you have to consider proportion and silhouette to make sure the tops and bottoms you choose interface well with each other if youve yet to take the time to identify what proportions you prefer and that work for your body into mind has a great proportions catalog to peruse ffa also has this guide to proportion

identify one or two silhouettes you want to wear on your trip  keeping in the mind the shoes and jackets youve already chosen  and pack items that work well with each other 

here are some examples of pairs of silhouettes that contain at least one overlapping element

 1 highwaisted bottoms  croppedlength tops and 2 fitandflare dresses  cropped cardigans the cropped cardigans work for both silhouettes over the dresses or with the highwaisted pants maximizing your versatility

 1 maxi skirt  fitted tops and 2 loose pants  fitted tops assuming you coordinate your colors well all the tops you bring could be worn with all of the bottoms you bring

 1 oversized tops  skinny jeans and 2 mini skirts  oversized pullovers again  you can wear the oversized tops with the pants or the skirts giving you the ability to change up your look and your silhouette with some of the same pieces

on comfort

dont try brandnew pieces or new combinations on a trip if you dont wear it at home youre unlikely to want to wear it while traveling and if you dont have experience wearing a piece you wont know its quirks  maybe it takes forever to dry shows water spots rides up when you walk wrinkles in a heartbeat or stinks a lot if you sweat etc aim to pack things you already wear often you know you like them you know they fit you know they look good with x shoes or y jacket you feel comfortable in them you feel confident wearing them these are all important points you want to enjoy your trip not spend all of your time feeling uncomfortable in your clothes

so based on those four main considerations weather activities versatility and comfort you can essentially work yourself through a flow chart of your own closet below ive given two examples of working my way through this strategy when packing for two different types of trips

example packing experience 1

4day trip to visit friends and their new baby in san francisco in january

1 whats the weather mid50s f sunny no rain forecasted great in that case i think ill bring my leather jacket and i have my choice of shoes since theres no rain i always walk a lot while im in sf though so well keep comfort in mind i put insoles in my vans and find them very comfortable for allday walking and since theres no rain the forecast i should be fine in canvas shoes ill probably bring those and my clogs which are also very comfortable for lots of walking

2 since im bringing my leather jacket all of my chunky sweaters are out because they wont fit under it so ill pick out a couple of thin sweaters and top layers that i know wear well under my leather jacket 

3 once ive picked the jacket and a couple of sweaters i choose some first layers tshirts buttonups blouses whatever that match i can also start choosing bottoms at this point for me its pantsjeans because im not really a skirt person especially in cooler temperatures remember to keep asking yourself what activities will i be doing i know on this trip ill be hanging out at my friends house with them and their baby so i dont want to pack fussy fabrics or fancy items like silk or cashmere because babies can be messy 

4 at this point its useful to start thinking about color my main neutrals are navy and denim and most of the other colors in my wardrobe go with those  and with each other gray cream burgundy mustard burnt orange olive green  so its pretty easy for me to pick some navydenim bottoms any combination of tops i like and go

5 now i consider proportion to make sure the tops and bottoms i chose interface well with each other personally my silhouette of choice is highwaisted bottoms  loose croppedlength or tuckedin tops so i might pack highwaisted dark denim some tops in cream and gray mostly fitted that i will wear tucked in since the temperature will be cool a cropped burnt orange sweater and a regular navy blue sweater knowing that i can mix and match all of it

example packing experience 2

8day trip to cuba to climb and explore in march 

1 whats the weather 80s and 90s f sunny but the possibility of rain so im definitely bringing my chacos because those are perfect hot  wet shoes especially in a developing country where i wont always be in big cities ill probably also bring birkenstocks for dry days and a slightly more polished look jackets just my lightweight rain jacket should do

2 activities im planning to sightsee and go rock climbing so im bringing a pair of climbing pants that i can also wear for hiking or horseback riding etc then i add 2 tank tops to climb in my favorite pair of highwaisted denim shorts and another tank and tee to wear when im not climbing two of the four tops im bringing are linen because hot the other two are merino wool because they wont start stinking immediately after i sweat in them and i can washdry them quickly ifwhen they do

3 its cuba and itll be hot so im bringing a swim suit because you never know ill also pack a casual tank dress that i can wear with the birks for a nicer dinner look or as a coverup for any potential beach trips 

4 color check the pants are gray and the shorts are denim all of the tops are rusty orange cream and gray the tank dress is navy blue looks like im good to go ill probably also pack my orange and gray flannel for any chilly moments and the plane this is basically my color scheme

5 proportion check pants shorts and tees are combos i wear often in the summer as a bonus im bringing one cropped tee and i can wear it over the tank dress to create a skirt look  a la  if i want

flesh out your outfits

one important step is to actually build outfits with the items youve chosen before you pack them for good lay everything out on your bed to see how the colors look together try on outfits to make sure you actually can wear that jacket with that dress or those shoes with those pants and that it works  that you like how it looks

this is also the time to see how many combinations you can make with the items youve chosen can you wear most of your tops with all of your bottoms what about first and second top layers sweaterscardigans over tankstees  are they flexible and interchangeable have you chosen any items that can only be worn with one other thing if so unless its for a specific occasion perhaps reconsider bringing it

in summary

1 start by asking yourself what the weather will be and what kinds of activities youll be doing choose some shoes and jackets based on the answers to those questions

2 use your shoejacket picks to help you narrow down your clothing choices always asking yourself if your choices are appropriate for the weather and your activities

3 consider color proportion and silhouette to ensure you can mix and match most of what you bring

4 bring comfortable trusted pieces that youre familiar with and already wear often

other general tips

 bring your favorites if you have that one sweater you find yourself wearing 2x or 3x per week pack it with your limited travel wardrobe you wont mind wearing that sweater a lot because you already do

 yes you can repeat outfits and rewear items several times no one will notice no one will care carry a stain remover pen to remove small marks

 scarves and jewelry can add interest variety and formality without taking up much space

 scarves use them 1 as a scarf 2 as a blanket 3 as a pillow 4 as a head covering in conservative or religious countries and settings 5 as a towel in a pinch 6 as a makeshift satchel hobostyle 7 as a privacy curtain or 8 as a skirt if its big enough

 i never recommend traveling with white pants skirts or dresses  too much can go wrong

 in general i like to travel with unfussy pieces and fabrics things that wont wrinkle easily things that are easy to wash 

 consider wool its lightweight it dries quickly it doesnt hold smells and you can confidently rewear wool items more times than other fabrics there are several companies that make highquality merino wool clothing items that are great for traveling smartwool ibex and icebreaker are my favorites

 for a oneoff formal occasion a dress or skirt can get you far dress it up or dress it down with a change of your shoes jewelry jacket andor hair a jersey dress or a jumpsuit or a lace skirt

 if space is at a premium bring old socks and underwear and throw them away before you come home 

 dont forget pajamas  if youre staying in someone elses home a hostel or anywhere else thats not completely private youll want a top  bottom you can wear around other people at night leggings or joggers  tee for example bonus if either piece is one you can also wear as part of an outfit if you need to

 i always bring a pair of cheap rubber flip flops no matter my destination for shower shoes for wearing around the house  hotel  hostel to the beach to the pool  you never know how they might come in handy

 if its a longer trip consider if youll be able to do laundry if you can maybe you can get away with packing a bit less and wearing a smaller number of items more often 

 warm weather tips maxi skirts maxi dresses and joggers are great for full coverage that wont make you overheat fabric suggestions include linen though prone to wrinkles and wool a linen or chambray buttondown is a great top layer for summer travel wear it alone over a tee or tied over a dress

 cold weather tips layers wool wool socks silk long underwear uniqlo heattech lightweight packable down jackets no cotton

femalefashionadvice,everlane,Your wardrobe is outdated. What now? Step 1 - Skinny jeans,"Do you feel stale? Is your wardrobe a little tired? Are the fashionable styles increasingly different from your own wardrobe? Is the last time you went shopping 10 years ago? Do you find yourself uttering the phrase ‚Äúcold dead hands‚Äù in the same sentence as ‚Äúskinny jeans‚Äù?
¬†


You might be a Millennial with an outdated wardrobe. 
¬†
¬†

It‚Äôs not a sin - if you still feel fun, fresh, and comfortable in your wardrobe, that‚Äôs cool, and feel free to click away. No one‚Äôs taking away your skinny jeans. 
¬†
¬†


If, however, you‚Äôre wondering how to update your wardrobe, make it feel a little fresher, and look more current, then you‚Äôre in the right place. 
¬†
¬†


The important thing to know is that a wardrobe update doesn‚Äôt mean that you need to throw away all your clothes and start over - unless that‚Äôs what you desire. You can update some key pieces and restyle some old ones in order to refresh your wardrobe and keep up with the times. 
¬†
¬†


The other thing to keep in mind is that wanting to be more current, and updating your wardrobe doesn‚Äôt mean you need to dress like a teenager. Nor does wanting a current wardrobe mean you‚Äôre desperately trying to look 20. It‚Äôs about being interested in style and wanting to remain current, stylish, and even - god forbid - trendy. Being interested in fashion and wanting to look modern isn‚Äôt just for the kids.¬† 
¬†
¬†








#Step 1 - Skinny jeans
¬†







¬†

We all know why you‚Äôre here, skinny jeans and your cold dead hands. Skinny jeans have become somewhat of a security blanket for a lot of people. It was the dominant silhouette for so long, and a lot of our wardrobes have been created around that. However, just like your college boyfriend, just because it‚Äôs comfortable and you met them when you were 20, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre married to them until you die. 
¬†
¬†










##Keeping your skinnies
¬†










Of course, no one is forcing anyone to give up their skinny jeans. Contrary to popular belief, the trend police will not break into your house to take them away, and your cold dead hands are safe, they needn‚Äôt be deployed. If you‚Äôre not going to replace them, then you can use a different styling approach. Styling them the same way you have been for 15 years will inevitably feel stale and old-fashioned. But that can be remedied by making some changes and tweaking other elements in your wardrobe. 
¬†











If you‚Äôre wearing skinny jeans,
¬†

##Don‚Äôt do this:
¬†
¬†






These are examples that *together* create looks that can feel a little stale, old-fashioned, and less than fresh. Just like skinny jeans, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to throw away these things, but maybe don‚Äôt style them together, in the exact same way you did in 2010. 
¬†





¬†

###1 Low/mid waist









¬†
Example: [low rise look](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201634/rs_634x1024-160404113513-634.Lauren-Conrad-Lo-Rise-Skinny-jeans.jl.040416.jpg?fit=around%7C776:1254&output-quality=90&crop=776:1254;center,top) 
¬†
¬†






Well, what‚Äôs wrong with low/mid-rise? And wait, isn‚Äôt low rise coming back in style? Yes, it is. Just not in skinny jeans. When the pants style changes (every 15 to 20 years), that usually brings a change in silhouette. In this case, we have moved from skinny bottom, oversized top, to skinny top, oversized bottom. 
¬†










In that case, wearing a slim, cropped shirt and low-rise, wide-leg pants is an outfit with a nice balance, that is meant to emphasize the midriff. Wearing the same cropped outfit with low-rise skinny jeans throws off the visual balance and just ends up looking like you‚Äôve outgrown your clothes because both elements are tight.
¬†









Seeing as tucking a shirt in or wearing a more cropped, boxy top is currently in style, that also poses a problem with mid or low rises, because they are [very awkward to tuck into](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5460/30851893355_a148f001a1_o.jpg). 










Once again, it disrupts the proportions and the visual balance. Tucking into low or mid rise skinny pants forces a 50/50 proportion that is both unnatural and not out of left field enough to be avant-garde. It‚Äôs [just awkward](https://www.herstylecode.com/2021/04/how-to-style-low-rise-jeans-low-rise-jeans-outfit-ideas-for-women_herstylecode-1.jpg). 
¬†
¬†







###2 Tunics/long sweaters

¬†







Example: [tunic top look](https://www.puttingmetogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maroon-tunic-leopard-scarf-fall-outfit-03-2-scaled.jpg)
¬†





¬†


Again, an issue of silhouette. Wearing skinny jeans with a tunic is probably your comfort zone, and while there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, it‚Äôs not going to read as modern or stylish. If that‚Äôs your goal, then I‚Äôd avoid pairing skinnies with any kind of long top. 










‚ÄúSkinny jeans and a nice top‚Äù can still be your go-to, but consider updating the style of the top. A top with more structure and more waist emphasis will read more modern than a long, loose, shapeless top. If you‚Äôre still keen on covering the derriere, then a boxy, oversized sweater or top with structure is a fresher alternative. 
¬†






###3 Thin long cardigans








¬†
Example: [look with long cardigan](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/c1/24/79c124f9856b1b5e0e9503de421c234d.jpg)
¬†









¬†
Cardigans made out of thin materials have never been especially flattering, because they tend to cling. It also makes it difficult to layer underneath them. The slimmer and thinner the cardigan, the bulkier the layers under it. A long, unstructured cardigan over skinny jeans is also an outdated silhouette. There are still duster cardigans out there, but they‚Äôre heavier, chunkier, and a little more oversized, occasionally with a tie waist. They allow layering and look more structured and less boho. 
¬†
¬†






###4 Ballet flats



¬†




¬†
Example: [ballet flat outfit](https://jljbacktoclassic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Janis-Lyn-Johnson-Talbots-Denim-Shirt-Louis-Vuitton-Speedy.png)
¬†
¬†









Grab your tutus, ballet flats are actually coming back into fashion. But paired with skinny jeans, the look is straight out of 2010. Thin soles and light, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù-type shoes are definitely not the freshest style (yes, that includes Rothys, but that‚Äôs a conversation for next time), but they can still be passable with a more modern pants cut - preferably something straight or wide leg, and cropped. [The new ballet flats](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/ballet-pumps-ss23) are also more dance-inspired, with specific detailing, so the round toe Tory Burch flats from 2008 are not exactly cutting edge. 
¬†
¬†








###5 Low ankle boots

¬†








¬†
Example: [low ankle boots outfit](https://cdn.lookastic.com/looks/vest-turtleneck-skinny-jeans-large-36449.jpg)
¬†







¬†
Like ballet flats, the time of low ankle boots has come and gone. Once, skinny jeans and ankle boots were the power couple of the early 2010s, now it‚Äôs just what middle-aged moms wear out to date night at Cheesecake Factory. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with any of that! But the ankle boot has also had a makeover - the shaft is higher, the heel is thicker, and the sole is chunkier. The Cheesecake Factory regulars won‚Äôt know what hit them.
¬†
¬†





###6 Tight knee high/OTK boots






¬†
¬†
Example: [OTK boots look](https://www.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/13.-With-Skinny-Jeans-And-Knee-Length-Boots.jpg)
¬†







¬†
I know skinny jeans and slim over the knee boots go together like peanut butter and jelly. And they did - for years and years. Which is precisely why that particular combination will read as dated. You can still keep both, just change up the styling, and don‚Äôt pair them together. Knee high boots are back in style, but instead of a 2010s slim riding boot, it‚Äôs [a wider, more generous cut with a chunkier sole](https://sheerluxe.com/sites/sheerluxe/files/styles/square_small/public/articles/2021/10/chunky-boots-trend-hero.jpg?itok=rJyQxw3y). The OTK boots can also still be worn, but rather with a mini skirt/dress, a slim midi skirt, or a pair of winter-weight shorts, like leather or tweed. 
¬†
¬†




###7 Graphic tees

¬†






¬†
Example: [graphic t-shirt look](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0225/2669/articles/starshell_birthday_girl_birthday_outfit_birthday_gift_247941b9-86e8-431e-bffd-173b156bc815_2048x.png)
¬†
¬†







If anything in your house or wardrobe says ‚ÄúLive, Laugh, Love‚Äù, I urge you to get rid of it immediately. Same with any saying related to coffee or the word ‚Äúvibe‚Äù. You‚Äôll thank me later. 
¬†








Now, I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt wear graphic t-shirts with skinny jeans. I‚Äôm saying the type of graphic t-shirt has changed a lot over the last 15 years. The slim fit, tiny sleeve crew neck t-shirts with flowery Etsy font is dead, you can downgrade it to the shirts you wear when you‚Äôre cleaning or painting. So is the thin, loose, cropped, 80s t-shirt that says ‚ÄúBridesmaid‚Äù. 
¬†








Instead, an oversized and boxy, OR straight fit t-shirt is [the more modern and current option](https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1674890613_542_Levis-CEO-says-skinny-jeans-are-brands-biggest-sellers-despite.jpg). Neither long nor short, neither wide nor tight, a comfortably loose t-shirt with a regular short sleeve is a perfect basic, non-offensive choice for any woman of any age. If it has to have a graphic, make it a band tee. Not something that says ‚ÄúNamaste‚Äù. 
¬†
¬†







¬†
###8 Big slouchy bags

¬†





¬†
Example: [big purse outfit](https://www.puttingmetogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/whitelushtunicoldnavydistressedjeansoutfit01-683x1024.jpg)
¬†
¬†







The LV Neverfull is a practical bag, I know, but wearing it with cropped skinny jeans and ballet flats looks like you‚Äôre cosplaying Christian Girl Autumn 10 years too late. A canvas tote bag is a more modern choice, or a sleek leather backpack. You‚Äôve got both the comfort and the style. For smaller bags and needs, an uncertain-shaped cross-body is also going to date your outfit. Try to be more intentional with the bag choice and shape. Something more structured, with a top handle (as well as a cross body strap) is a fresher choice. Or a small, perhaps embellished, backpack.
¬†
¬†






##Do this instead:
¬†







I would like to first preface this by saying that you do not have to do ALL of these. These are also not mandates. They‚Äôre options. I picked a few different categories where updating other elements of your outfit can make skinny jeans feel less stale in 2023, something for everyone. 
¬†




###1 High waist

¬†




¬†
Example: [high-waisted look]
(https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-everygirl-skinny-jeans-900-1200.jpg)
¬†





¬†
Updating the rise is the easiest way to bring your skinnies into 2023. A higher rise gives you some new and modern styling options, including tucking tops into your jeans or wearing tops that are more cropped - t-shirts, shirts, blouses, hoodies, jackets - they all look better with a higher rise to balance out the silhouette. High waisted jeans make your legs look longer, they emphasize the waist, and are comfortable to sit in, since the waist should hit at your natural waist, *above* your stomach, and not cutting into it. 
¬†
¬†






###2 Full length hems

¬†






¬†
Example: [full length skinnies outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ee/b0/3a/eeb03a9805920ee1f91b3691b833b5b0.jpg)
¬†








¬†
Another style element that betrays the age of your skinny jeans is that outdated, scrunched or cropped look. This may very well be a matter of opinion, but cropped skinny jeans don‚Äôt work as well as other cropped styles. Because they‚Äôre so tight, it visually strangles your calf instead of highlighting the ankle and has the opposite effect. The overly long, scrunched look is not just outdated, it‚Äôs a sign your jeans don‚Äôt fit well. Petites, hem your skinny jeans - or buy the cropped ones as full length). Full length skinnies have a more streamlined look and work better with any type of shoe. 
¬†
¬†








###3 Belts

¬†







¬†
Example: [belted skinnies look](https://cdn.lookastic.com/looks/dress-shirt-skinny-jeans-bandana-original-32420.jpg)
¬†










¬†
A high rise goes great with a belt, both to highlight your waist - if that‚Äôs the look you‚Äôre after - and to serve as an extra accessory and styling device. Belting your jeans can tie in your shoes or bag in a nice way, or it can visually break up a fit that needs a little extra something-something. Be advised that belting a pair of pants that do not sit at your waist will emphasize your hips or stomach, so if you‚Äôre not keen on making that area seem wider, then avoid belting and/or tucking into mid or low rise bottoms.
¬†
¬†








###4 Cropped cardigans

¬†







¬†
Example: [boxy cardi look](https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/291678/madewell-basics-reviews-291678-1613597254143-image.700x0c.jpg)
¬†
¬†












It‚Äôs time to let go of this weird notion that a cropped silhouette is only for 15 year-olds. A cropped top, shirt, cardigan, jacket, etc. is simply a change in silhouette and proportion and it does not - I repeat, it does *not* mean that you‚Äôre necessarily showing off your midriff or that it‚Äôs a strictly ‚Äúyouthful‚Äù style. 
¬†










The key to incorporating a cropped element is to pair it with high rise bottoms - in this case, your skinnies. Styling them with an opposite style cardigan - short and bulky, instead of long and thin - automatically freshens up the look and brings them into 2023. High rise + crop shirt is an excellent way to emphasize the waist or create an hourglass or pear silhouette. Like a belt, the ‚Äúbreak‚Äù in the outfit can be a much needed styling element to take the outfit from basic to stylish. 
¬†
¬†












###5 Oversized blazers

¬†








¬†
Example: [oversized blazer outfit](https://media.vogue.mx/photos/62155a20700ff81dbaf0137a/master/pass/skinny-jeans-con-botas-modelos-street-style.jpg)
¬†
¬†








Raise your hand if you wore skinny jeans, low cut ankle boots and a blazer in 2010. I‚Äôm not knocking it, it‚Äôs a good look, but when worn all together, it dates you. But you can update the look by swapping out the blazer with a more current, oversized style. An oversized blazer vs. a shorter, slimmer fit one from the 2010s makes great contrast with the tightness of the pants and it gives the outfit a cooler, slightly masculine edge. While an all-tight outfit can look a little try-hard, an oversized element makes it a little cooler and more modern. 
¬†
¬†
¬†






###6 Tucked in tops

¬†






¬†

Example: [tucked in look](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/08/92/c7/0892c747539c951a79e3513520cc55b0.jpg)
¬†

¬†








Tucking is one of my favorite styling choices and I can‚Äôt find much fault with it. In fact, it may very well make skinny jeans look modern. Like belts and crop tops, tucking in a shirt achieves the same waist emphasis we‚Äôre going for and it pulls away from the outdated lowrise + muffin top + long shirt look of the 2010s. 
¬†
¬†







###7 Chunky shoes

Shoes can totally transform an outfit, including taking it from 2013 to 2023. No one‚Äôs trying to take away your heeled ankle boots, but consider pairing those with a cropped straight leg instead, and swap them out for a pair of chunky loafers or platform boot in a skinny jean outfit. Same with ballet flats, let‚Äôs mix and match trends and decades instead of doing The Greatest Hits of 2011 from head to toe. 
¬†
¬†








###8 Voluminous tops
¬†







¬†
Example: [voluminous top outfit](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57a37eb520099e5233bca0e2/1611597298576-QMNSYBG4SGMMLHZ7N9S9/blue-med-skinny-jeans-black-top-white-bag-clutch-black-shoe-sandalh-brun-hoops-sheer-trend-spring-summer-dinner-puffsleeves.jpg)
¬†
¬†











So we said no long tops - what do we do for ‚Äúnice‚Äù tops, instead? There are a few different details that make for a modern top. Volume is one of the key words, so a top that is short and boxy OR that has [voluminous sleeves](https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/best-plus-size-jeans-asos-collusion-x-005.png?fit=728%2C921) OR a voluminous collar, etc. Very feminine corset tops are also very popular, with or without sleeves or straps. Square necklines are extremely flattering on everyone and can be the one feature on an otherwise completely basic top that can have long sleeves or be tucked into the pants, etc. As for sweaters, [bulky wins over slim fitting](https://bergereinrock.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/inspirations-fall-mood-grey-knit-steetstyle-theworldofbergere.jpg) for a modern look.

##Alternatives to skinny jeans
¬†
¬†










If you‚Äôre ready to move on and see what else is out there, then a world of new styles awaits you. You‚Äôll be surprised at how much variety and excitement you can add to your wardrobe with one simple jean style swap. The beautiful thing about transitional periods in fashion is that there‚Äôs something for everybody. There is no primary cut or style, so you can find anything. Slim, baggy, wide leg, bell bottoms, bootcuts, high rise, low, or mid, it‚Äôs all out there, and you can make any of them work for you. 
¬†










###Straight leg jeans
¬†








A good alternative are straight leg jeans and pants - the shape is not a huge departure from your usual, while still being more modern. Straight leg jeans still allow for some of your longer tops to be worn without looking baggy from top to bottom, you can still wear them with higher boots if you want, and they‚Äôre not very adventurous, which means they‚Äôre never the focus of the outfit itself. 
¬†







They can play it safe and be quietly understated to support other, more interesting design elements, whether it‚Äôs a big sleeve, a bold color, a collar, a ruffle, interesting buttons, or other detailing on your top, coat, or accessories. This style can still be successfully worn with a boxier or longer sweater, for example, without looking outdated. 
¬†
¬†

¬†





###Mom jeans





Mom jeans are the cut that largely replaced skinny jeans back in 2015-2016. Favored because they‚Äôre very high waisted, with more room in the hips, and a flattering, conical shape, they are as comfortable as they are durable, owing to their rigid, 100% cotton fabric. However, because of the lack of elastane in their composition, mom jeans are trickier to size, so a few shopping trips may be necessary. 
¬†





For skinny jeans wearers, the familiar thing with mom jeans is that they retain the high waist, and you‚Äôre still showing off your shoes, as they‚Äôre closely cut around the ankle, and usually a little cropped. Like straight leg jeans, an oversized, untucked top can still look good and fresh with this cut because of the conical shape. They slim down towards the ankle, giving the leg a little shape that contrasts with the baggy top, if you don‚Äôt want to go for a loose-on-loose silhouette. 
¬†

¬†











###Wide leg jeans









The other prominent cut that arose in the meantime are wide leg jeans, which are very much a total departure from skinny jeans, in terms of shape and style. However, they have become extremely popular, even among older Millennials, because they‚Äôre very comfortable. 
¬†










High waisted, with a lot of room in the hips and leg, wide leg jeans allow for free movement and completely eliminate the constricted feeling skinny jeans can sometimes be guilty of. Usually cropped, they still allow you to show off your shoes, and are surprisingly versatile. They can be successfully worn with boots, sandals, loafers, birks, heels, or flats - they go with pretty much anything. Personally, I prefer them with boots. 
¬†

¬†








###Flared jeans













However, you can also obtain some of the same effects as skinnies with bootcut or flared pants. When you think about it, flared pants aren‚Äôt all that different. Yes, the flare at the bottom is a change in silhouette and it‚Äôs more visual interest than you‚Äôre used to having with pants. However, the top is very much still the same fit as skinny jeans, if what you‚Äôre concerned about is losing a ‚Äúflattering‚Äù shape around your waist/butt/thighs. Flares tend to be the same skinny shape on top, and still have elastane. 
¬†







The only thing you‚Äôre trading in is the way you‚Äôre pairing your shoes. The longer hems visually elongate the legs, but they do usually cover the shoes, so more thought will need to be put into that. Heels work best paired with flared pants, but with the chunky, platform styles of today, flats can also be worn successfully with bootcut and flared, and wide leg pants, even without dragging and stepping on your hems.
¬†
¬†

¬†




I‚Äôd also like to make a note that hair, makeup, and general styling (like jewelry) also make a big impact in the way outfits are perceived. With a modern, intentional haircut, any outfit automatically reads are more stylish, instead of just the first thing you grabbed that looked like pants.
¬†







¬†
Makeup plays an equally big role. Overplucked eyebrows made an entire generation of women look like they were stuck in the past, as does harsh contouring, and other major elements of hair and makeup, like thick, blocky eyebrows. The Kate Gosselin haircut, the too-light blonde hair curled with a 2-inch barrel curling iron that every single woman on Pinterest has, the ring finger painted in a¬† different color than all the others. 
¬†
¬†






Think of those ladies who wore permed hair and blue eyeshadow into the 90s and 00s. You don‚Äôt want to be the 2023 version of that lady - *unless* you do it extremely well and intentional for the camp factor. 
¬†
¬†





If you found this helpful, I‚Äôm interested in creating more spotlight posts on specific items that can be updated. We could just do bigger categories - shoes, outerwear, dresses, etc. or we could focus on one specific item people are finding particularly difficult to part with, but would like to freshen up. If you have any ideas or requests, please let me know.

You can read part 2 about office wear here: https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11m7yxr/updating_an_outdated_wardrobe_part_2_office_wear/",1677437484.0,"Your wardrobe is outdated. What now? Step 1 - Skinny jeans Do you feel stale? Is your wardrobe a little tired? Are the fashionable styles increasingly different from your own wardrobe? Is the last time you went shopping 10 years ago? Do you find yourself uttering the phrase ‚Äúcold dead hands‚Äù in the same sentence as ‚Äúskinny jeans‚Äù?
¬†


You might be a Millennial with an outdated wardrobe. 
¬†
¬†

It‚Äôs not a sin - if you still feel fun, fresh, and comfortable in your wardrobe, that‚Äôs cool, and feel free to click away. No one‚Äôs taking away your skinny jeans. 
¬†
¬†


If, however, you‚Äôre wondering how to update your wardrobe, make it feel a little fresher, and look more current, then you‚Äôre in the right place. 
¬†
¬†


The important thing to know is that a wardrobe update doesn‚Äôt mean that you need to throw away all your clothes and start over - unless that‚Äôs what you desire. You can update some key pieces and restyle some old ones in order to refresh your wardrobe and keep up with the times. 
¬†
¬†


The other thing to keep in mind is that wanting to be more current, and updating your wardrobe doesn‚Äôt mean you need to dress like a teenager. Nor does wanting a current wardrobe mean you‚Äôre desperately trying to look 20. It‚Äôs about being interested in style and wanting to remain current, stylish, and even - god forbid - trendy. Being interested in fashion and wanting to look modern isn‚Äôt just for the kids.¬† 
¬†
¬†








#Step 1 - Skinny jeans
¬†







¬†

We all know why you‚Äôre here, skinny jeans and your cold dead hands. Skinny jeans have become somewhat of a security blanket for a lot of people. It was the dominant silhouette for so long, and a lot of our wardrobes have been created around that. However, just like your college boyfriend, just because it‚Äôs comfortable and you met them when you were 20, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre married to them until you die. 
¬†
¬†










##Keeping your skinnies
¬†










Of course, no one is forcing anyone to give up their skinny jeans. Contrary to popular belief, the trend police will not break into your house to take them away, and your cold dead hands are safe, they needn‚Äôt be deployed. If you‚Äôre not going to replace them, then you can use a different styling approach. Styling them the same way you have been for 15 years will inevitably feel stale and old-fashioned. But that can be remedied by making some changes and tweaking other elements in your wardrobe. 
¬†











If you‚Äôre wearing skinny jeans,
¬†

##Don‚Äôt do this:
¬†
¬†






These are examples that *together* create looks that can feel a little stale, old-fashioned, and less than fresh. Just like skinny jeans, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to throw away these things, but maybe don‚Äôt style them together, in the exact same way you did in 2010. 
¬†





¬†

###1 Low/mid waist









¬†
Example: [low rise look](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201634/rs_634x1024-160404113513-634.Lauren-Conrad-Lo-Rise-Skinny-jeans.jl.040416.jpg?fit=around%7C776:1254&output-quality=90&crop=776:1254;center,top) 
¬†
¬†






Well, what‚Äôs wrong with low/mid-rise? And wait, isn‚Äôt low rise coming back in style? Yes, it is. Just not in skinny jeans. When the pants style changes (every 15 to 20 years), that usually brings a change in silhouette. In this case, we have moved from skinny bottom, oversized top, to skinny top, oversized bottom. 
¬†










In that case, wearing a slim, cropped shirt and low-rise, wide-leg pants is an outfit with a nice balance, that is meant to emphasize the midriff. Wearing the same cropped outfit with low-rise skinny jeans throws off the visual balance and just ends up looking like you‚Äôve outgrown your clothes because both elements are tight.
¬†









Seeing as tucking a shirt in or wearing a more cropped, boxy top is currently in style, that also poses a problem with mid or low rises, because they are [very awkward to tuck into](https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5460/30851893355_a148f001a1_o.jpg). 










Once again, it disrupts the proportions and the visual balance. Tucking into low or mid rise skinny pants forces a 50/50 proportion that is both unnatural and not out of left field enough to be avant-garde. It‚Äôs [just awkward](https://www.herstylecode.com/2021/04/how-to-style-low-rise-jeans-low-rise-jeans-outfit-ideas-for-women_herstylecode-1.jpg). 
¬†
¬†







###2 Tunics/long sweaters

¬†







Example: [tunic top look](https://www.puttingmetogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/maroon-tunic-leopard-scarf-fall-outfit-03-2-scaled.jpg)
¬†





¬†


Again, an issue of silhouette. Wearing skinny jeans with a tunic is probably your comfort zone, and while there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, it‚Äôs not going to read as modern or stylish. If that‚Äôs your goal, then I‚Äôd avoid pairing skinnies with any kind of long top. 










‚ÄúSkinny jeans and a nice top‚Äù can still be your go-to, but consider updating the style of the top. A top with more structure and more waist emphasis will read more modern than a long, loose, shapeless top. If you‚Äôre still keen on covering the derriere, then a boxy, oversized sweater or top with structure is a fresher alternative. 
¬†






###3 Thin long cardigans








¬†
Example: [look with long cardigan](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/79/c1/24/79c124f9856b1b5e0e9503de421c234d.jpg)
¬†









¬†
Cardigans made out of thin materials have never been especially flattering, because they tend to cling. It also makes it difficult to layer underneath them. The slimmer and thinner the cardigan, the bulkier the layers under it. A long, unstructured cardigan over skinny jeans is also an outdated silhouette. There are still duster cardigans out there, but they‚Äôre heavier, chunkier, and a little more oversized, occasionally with a tie waist. They allow layering and look more structured and less boho. 
¬†
¬†






###4 Ballet flats



¬†




¬†
Example: [ballet flat outfit](https://jljbacktoclassic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Janis-Lyn-Johnson-Talbots-Denim-Shirt-Louis-Vuitton-Speedy.png)
¬†
¬†









Grab your tutus, ballet flats are actually coming back into fashion. But paired with skinny jeans, the look is straight out of 2010. Thin soles and light, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù-type shoes are definitely not the freshest style (yes, that includes Rothys, but that‚Äôs a conversation for next time), but they can still be passable with a more modern pants cut - preferably something straight or wide leg, and cropped. [The new ballet flats](https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/ballet-pumps-ss23) are also more dance-inspired, with specific detailing, so the round toe Tory Burch flats from 2008 are not exactly cutting edge. 
¬†
¬†








###5 Low ankle boots

¬†








¬†
Example: [low ankle boots outfit](https://cdn.lookastic.com/looks/vest-turtleneck-skinny-jeans-large-36449.jpg)
¬†







¬†
Like ballet flats, the time of low ankle boots has come and gone. Once, skinny jeans and ankle boots were the power couple of the early 2010s, now it‚Äôs just what middle-aged moms wear out to date night at Cheesecake Factory. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with any of that! But the ankle boot has also had a makeover - the shaft is higher, the heel is thicker, and the sole is chunkier. The Cheesecake Factory regulars won‚Äôt know what hit them.
¬†
¬†





###6 Tight knee high/OTK boots






¬†
¬†
Example: [OTK boots look](https://www.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/13.-With-Skinny-Jeans-And-Knee-Length-Boots.jpg)
¬†







¬†
I know skinny jeans and slim over the knee boots go together like peanut butter and jelly. And they did - for years and years. Which is precisely why that particular combination will read as dated. You can still keep both, just change up the styling, and don‚Äôt pair them together. Knee high boots are back in style, but instead of a 2010s slim riding boot, it‚Äôs [a wider, more generous cut with a chunkier sole](https://sheerluxe.com/sites/sheerluxe/files/styles/square_small/public/articles/2021/10/chunky-boots-trend-hero.jpg?itok=rJyQxw3y). The OTK boots can also still be worn, but rather with a mini skirt/dress, a slim midi skirt, or a pair of winter-weight shorts, like leather or tweed. 
¬†
¬†




###7 Graphic tees

¬†






¬†
Example: [graphic t-shirt look](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0225/2669/articles/starshell_birthday_girl_birthday_outfit_birthday_gift_247941b9-86e8-431e-bffd-173b156bc815_2048x.png)
¬†
¬†







If anything in your house or wardrobe says ‚ÄúLive, Laugh, Love‚Äù, I urge you to get rid of it immediately. Same with any saying related to coffee or the word ‚Äúvibe‚Äù. You‚Äôll thank me later. 
¬†








Now, I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt wear graphic t-shirts with skinny jeans. I‚Äôm saying the type of graphic t-shirt has changed a lot over the last 15 years. The slim fit, tiny sleeve crew neck t-shirts with flowery Etsy font is dead, you can downgrade it to the shirts you wear when you‚Äôre cleaning or painting. So is the thin, loose, cropped, 80s t-shirt that says ‚ÄúBridesmaid‚Äù. 
¬†








Instead, an oversized and boxy, OR straight fit t-shirt is [the more modern and current option](https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1674890613_542_Levis-CEO-says-skinny-jeans-are-brands-biggest-sellers-despite.jpg). Neither long nor short, neither wide nor tight, a comfortably loose t-shirt with a regular short sleeve is a perfect basic, non-offensive choice for any woman of any age. If it has to have a graphic, make it a band tee. Not something that says ‚ÄúNamaste‚Äù. 
¬†
¬†







¬†
###8 Big slouchy bags

¬†





¬†
Example: [big purse outfit](https://www.puttingmetogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/whitelushtunicoldnavydistressedjeansoutfit01-683x1024.jpg)
¬†
¬†







The LV Neverfull is a practical bag, I know, but wearing it with cropped skinny jeans and ballet flats looks like you‚Äôre cosplaying Christian Girl Autumn 10 years too late. A canvas tote bag is a more modern choice, or a sleek leather backpack. You‚Äôve got both the comfort and the style. For smaller bags and needs, an uncertain-shaped cross-body is also going to date your outfit. Try to be more intentional with the bag choice and shape. Something more structured, with a top handle (as well as a cross body strap) is a fresher choice. Or a small, perhaps embellished, backpack.
¬†
¬†






##Do this instead:
¬†







I would like to first preface this by saying that you do not have to do ALL of these. These are also not mandates. They‚Äôre options. I picked a few different categories where updating other elements of your outfit can make skinny jeans feel less stale in 2023, something for everyone. 
¬†




###1 High waist

¬†




¬†
Example: [high-waisted look]
(https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-everygirl-skinny-jeans-900-1200.jpg)
¬†





¬†
Updating the rise is the easiest way to bring your skinnies into 2023. A higher rise gives you some new and modern styling options, including tucking tops into your jeans or wearing tops that are more cropped - t-shirts, shirts, blouses, hoodies, jackets - they all look better with a higher rise to balance out the silhouette. High waisted jeans make your legs look longer, they emphasize the waist, and are comfortable to sit in, since the waist should hit at your natural waist, *above* your stomach, and not cutting into it. 
¬†
¬†






###2 Full length hems

¬†






¬†
Example: [full length skinnies outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ee/b0/3a/eeb03a9805920ee1f91b3691b833b5b0.jpg)
¬†








¬†
Another style element that betrays the age of your skinny jeans is that outdated, scrunched or cropped look. This may very well be a matter of opinion, but cropped skinny jeans don‚Äôt work as well as other cropped styles. Because they‚Äôre so tight, it visually strangles your calf instead of highlighting the ankle and has the opposite effect. The overly long, scrunched look is not just outdated, it‚Äôs a sign your jeans don‚Äôt fit well. Petites, hem your skinny jeans - or buy the cropped ones as full length). Full length skinnies have a more streamlined look and work better with any type of shoe. 
¬†
¬†








###3 Belts

¬†







¬†
Example: [belted skinnies look](https://cdn.lookastic.com/looks/dress-shirt-skinny-jeans-bandana-original-32420.jpg)
¬†










¬†
A high rise goes great with a belt, both to highlight your waist - if that‚Äôs the look you‚Äôre after - and to serve as an extra accessory and styling device. Belting your jeans can tie in your shoes or bag in a nice way, or it can visually break up a fit that needs a little extra something-something. Be advised that belting a pair of pants that do not sit at your waist will emphasize your hips or stomach, so if you‚Äôre not keen on making that area seem wider, then avoid belting and/or tucking into mid or low rise bottoms.
¬†
¬†








###4 Cropped cardigans

¬†







¬†
Example: [boxy cardi look](https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/291678/madewell-basics-reviews-291678-1613597254143-image.700x0c.jpg)
¬†
¬†












It‚Äôs time to let go of this weird notion that a cropped silhouette is only for 15 year-olds. A cropped top, shirt, cardigan, jacket, etc. is simply a change in silhouette and proportion and it does not - I repeat, it does *not* mean that you‚Äôre necessarily showing off your midriff or that it‚Äôs a strictly ‚Äúyouthful‚Äù style. 
¬†










The key to incorporating a cropped element is to pair it with high rise bottoms - in this case, your skinnies. Styling them with an opposite style cardigan - short and bulky, instead of long and thin - automatically freshens up the look and brings them into 2023. High rise + crop shirt is an excellent way to emphasize the waist or create an hourglass or pear silhouette. Like a belt, the ‚Äúbreak‚Äù in the outfit can be a much needed styling element to take the outfit from basic to stylish. 
¬†
¬†












###5 Oversized blazers

¬†








¬†
Example: [oversized blazer outfit](https://media.vogue.mx/photos/62155a20700ff81dbaf0137a/master/pass/skinny-jeans-con-botas-modelos-street-style.jpg)
¬†
¬†








Raise your hand if you wore skinny jeans, low cut ankle boots and a blazer in 2010. I‚Äôm not knocking it, it‚Äôs a good look, but when worn all together, it dates you. But you can update the look by swapping out the blazer with a more current, oversized style. An oversized blazer vs. a shorter, slimmer fit one from the 2010s makes great contrast with the tightness of the pants and it gives the outfit a cooler, slightly masculine edge. While an all-tight outfit can look a little try-hard, an oversized element makes it a little cooler and more modern. 
¬†
¬†
¬†






###6 Tucked in tops

¬†






¬†

Example: [tucked in look](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/08/92/c7/0892c747539c951a79e3513520cc55b0.jpg)

Tucking is one of my favorite styling choices and I can‚Äôt find much fault with it. In fact, it may very well make skinny jeans look modern. Like belts and crop tops, tucking in a shirt achieves the same waist emphasis we‚Äôre going for and it pulls away from the outdated lowrise + muffin top + long shirt look of the 2010s.

###7 Chunky shoes

Shoes can totally transform an outfit, including taking it from 2013 to 2023. No one‚Äôs trying to take away your heeled ankle boots, but consider pairing those with a cropped straight leg instead, and swap them out for a pair of chunky loafers or platform boot in a skinny jean outfit. Same with ballet flats, let‚Äôs mix and match trends and decades instead of doing The Greatest Hits of 2011 from head to toe. 
¬†
¬†








###8 Voluminous tops
¬†







¬†
Example: [voluminous top outfit](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57a37eb520099e5233bca0e2/1611597298576-QMNSYBG4SGMMLHZ7N9S9/blue-med-skinny-jeans-black-top-white-bag-clutch-black-shoe-sandalh-brun-hoops-sheer-trend-spring-summer-dinner-puffsleeves.jpg)
¬†
¬†











So we said no long tops - what do we do for ‚Äúnice‚Äù tops, instead? There are a few different details that make for a modern top. Volume is one of the key words, so a top that is short and boxy OR that has [voluminous sleeves](https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/best-plus-size-jeans-asos-collusion-x-005.png?fit=728%2C921) OR a voluminous collar, etc. Very feminine corset tops are also very popular, with or without sleeves or straps. Square necklines are extremely flattering on everyone and can be the one feature on an otherwise completely basic top that can have long sleeves or be tucked into the pants, etc. As for sweaters, [bulky wins over slim fitting](https://bergereinrock.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/inspirations-fall-mood-grey-knit-steetstyle-theworldofbergere.jpg) for a modern look.

##Alternatives to skinny jeans
¬†
¬†










If you‚Äôre ready to move on and see what else is out there, then a world of new styles awaits you. You‚Äôll be surprised at how much variety and excitement you can add to your wardrobe with one simple jean style swap. The beautiful thing about transitional periods in fashion is that there‚Äôs something for everybody. There is no primary cut or style, so you can find anything. Slim, baggy, wide leg, bell bottoms, bootcuts, high rise, low, or mid, it‚Äôs all out there, and you can make any of them work for you. 
¬†










###Straight leg jeans
¬†








A good alternative are straight leg jeans and pants - the shape is not a huge departure from your usual, while still being more modern. Straight leg jeans still allow for some of your longer tops to be worn without looking baggy from top to bottom, you can still wear them with higher boots if you want, and they‚Äôre not very adventurous, which means they‚Äôre never the focus of the outfit itself. 
¬†







They can play it safe and be quietly understated to support other, more interesting design elements, whether it‚Äôs a big sleeve, a bold color, a collar, a ruffle, interesting buttons, or other detailing on your top, coat, or accessories. This style can still be successfully worn with a boxier or longer sweater, for example, without looking outdated. 
¬†
¬†

###Mom jeans





Mom jeans are the cut that largely replaced skinny jeans back in 2015-2016. Favored because they‚Äôre very high waisted, with more room in the hips, and a flattering, conical shape, they are as comfortable as they are durable, owing to their rigid, 100% cotton fabric. However, because of the lack of elastane in their composition, mom jeans are trickier to size, so a few shopping trips may be necessary. 
¬†





For skinny jeans wearers, the familiar thing with mom jeans is that they retain the high waist, and you‚Äôre still showing off your shoes, as they‚Äôre closely cut around the ankle, and usually a little cropped. Like straight leg jeans, an oversized, untucked top can still look good and fresh with this cut because of the conical shape. They slim down towards the ankle, giving the leg a little shape that contrasts with the baggy top, if you don‚Äôt want to go for a loose-on-loose silhouette. 
¬†

¬†











###Wide leg jeans









The other prominent cut that arose in the meantime are wide leg jeans, which are very much a total departure from skinny jeans, in terms of shape and style. However, they have become extremely popular, even among older Millennials, because they‚Äôre very comfortable. 
¬†










High waisted, with a lot of room in the hips and leg, wide leg jeans allow for free movement and completely eliminate the constricted feeling skinny jeans can sometimes be guilty of. Usually cropped, they still allow you to show off your shoes, and are surprisingly versatile. They can be successfully worn with boots, sandals, loafers, birks, heels, or flats - they go with pretty much anything. Personally, I prefer them with boots. 
¬†
¬†

¬†








###Flared jeans













However, you can also obtain some of the same effects as skinnies with bootcut or flared pants. When you think about it, flared pants aren‚Äôt all that different. Yes, the flare at the bottom is a change in silhouette and it‚Äôs more visual interest than you‚Äôre used to having with pants. However, the top is very much still the same fit as skinny jeans, if what you‚Äôre concerned about is losing a ‚Äúflattering‚Äù shape around your waist/butt/thighs. Flares tend to be the same skinny shape on top, and still have elastane. 
¬†







The only thing you‚Äôre trading in is the way you‚Äôre pairing your shoes. The longer hems visually elongate the legs, but they do usually cover the shoes, so more thought will need to be put into that. Heels work best paired with flared pants, but with the chunky, platform styles of today, flats can also be worn successfully with bootcut and flared, and wide leg pants, even without dragging and stepping on your hems.
¬†
¬†

¬†
¬†




I‚Äôd also like to make a note that hair, makeup, and general styling (like jewelry) also make a big impact in the way outfits are perceived. With a modern, intentional haircut, any outfit automatically reads are more stylish, instead of just the first thing you grabbed that looked like pants.
¬†







¬†
Makeup plays an equally big role. Overplucked eyebrows made an entire generation of women look like they were stuck in the past, as does harsh contouring, and other major elements of hair and makeup, like thick, blocky eyebrows. The Kate Gosselin haircut, the too-light blonde hair curled with a 2-inch barrel curling iron that every single woman on Pinterest has, the ring finger painted in a¬† different color than all the others. 
¬†
¬†






Think of those ladies who wore permed hair and blue eyeshadow into the 90s and 00s. You don‚Äôt want to be the 2023 version of that lady - *unless* you do it extremely well and intentional for the camp factor. 
¬†
¬†





If you found this helpful, I‚Äôm interested in creating more spotlight posts on specific items that can be updated. We could just do bigger categories - shoes, outerwear, dresses, etc. or we could focus on one specific item people are finding particularly difficult to part with, but would like to freshen up. If you have any ideas or requests, please let me know.

You can read part 2 about office wear here: https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11m7yxr/updating_an_outdated_wardrobe_part_2_office_wear/","your wardrobe is outdated what now step 1  skinny jeans do you feel stale is your wardrobe a little tired are the fashionable styles increasingly different from your own wardrobe is the last time you went shopping 10 years ago do you find yourself uttering the phrase  cold dead hands  in the same sentence as  skinny jeans 
 


you might be a millennial with an outdated wardrobe 
 
 

it s not a sin  if you still feel fun fresh and comfortable in your wardrobe that s cool and feel free to click away no one s taking away your skinny jeans 
 
 


if however you re wondering how to update your wardrobe make it feel a little fresher and look more current then you re in the right place 
 
 


the important thing to know is that a wardrobe update doesn t mean that you need to throw away all your clothes and start over  unless that s what you desire you can update some key pieces and restyle some old ones in order to refresh your wardrobe and keep up with the times 
 
 


the other thing to keep in mind is that wanting to be more current and updating your wardrobe doesn t mean you need to dress like a teenager nor does wanting a current wardrobe mean you re desperately trying to look 20 it s about being interested in style and wanting to remain current stylish and even  god forbid  trendy being interested in fashion and wanting to look modern isn t just for the kids  
 
 








step 1  skinny jeans
 







 

we all know why you re here skinny jeans and your cold dead hands skinny jeans have become somewhat of a security blanket for a lot of people it was the dominant silhouette for so long and a lot of our wardrobes have been created around that however just like your college boyfriend just because it s comfortable and you met them when you were 20 it doesn t mean you re married to them until you die 
 
 










keeping your skinnies
 










of course no one is forcing anyone to give up their skinny jeans contrary to popular belief the trend police will not break into your house to take them away and your cold dead hands are safe they needn t be deployed if you re not going to replace them then you can use a different styling approach styling them the same way you have been for 15 years will inevitably feel stale and oldfashioned but that can be remedied by making some changes and tweaking other elements in your wardrobe 
 











if you re wearing skinny jeans
 

don t do this
 
 






these are examples that together create looks that can feel a little stale oldfashioned and less than fresh just like skinny jeans it doesn t mean that you have to throw away these things but maybe don t style them together in the exact same way you did in 2010 
 





 

1 lowmid waist









 
example low rise look 
 
 






well what s wrong with lowmidrise and wait isn t low rise coming back in style yes it is just not in skinny jeans when the pants style changes every 15 to 20 years that usually brings a change in silhouette in this case we have moved from skinny bottom oversized top to skinny top oversized bottom 
 










in that case wearing a slim cropped shirt and lowrise wideleg pants is an outfit with a nice balance that is meant to emphasize the midriff wearing the same cropped outfit with lowrise skinny jeans throws off the visual balance and just ends up looking like you ve outgrown your clothes because both elements are tight
 









seeing as tucking a shirt in or wearing a more cropped boxy top is currently in style that also poses a problem with mid or low rises because they are very awkward to tuck into 










once again it disrupts the proportions and the visual balance tucking into low or mid rise skinny pants forces a 5050 proportion that is both unnatural and not out of left field enough to be avantgarde it s just awkward 
 
 







2 tunicslong sweaters

 







example tunic top look
 





 


again an issue of silhouette wearing skinny jeans with a tunic is probably your comfort zone and while there s nothing wrong with that it s not going to read as modern or stylish if that s your goal then i d avoid pairing skinnies with any kind of long top 










 skinny jeans and a nice top  can still be your goto but consider updating the style of the top a top with more structure and more waist emphasis will read more modern than a long loose shapeless top if you re still keen on covering the derriere then a boxy oversized sweater or top with structure is a fresher alternative 
 






3 thin long cardigans








 
example look with long cardigan
 









 
cardigans made out of thin materials have never been especially flattering because they tend to cling it also makes it difficult to layer underneath them the slimmer and thinner the cardigan the bulkier the layers under it a long unstructured cardigan over skinny jeans is also an outdated silhouette there are still duster cardigans out there but they re heavier chunkier and a little more oversized occasionally with a tie waist they allow layering and look more structured and less boho 
 
 






4 ballet flats



 




 
example ballet flat outfit
 
 









grab your tutus ballet flats are actually coming back into fashion but paired with skinny jeans the look is straight out of 2010 thin soles and light  nothing type shoes are definitely not the freshest style yes that includes rothys but that s a conversation for next time but they can still be passable with a more modern pants cut  preferably something straight or wide leg and cropped the new ballet flats are also more danceinspired with specific detailing so the round toe tory burch flats from 2008 are not exactly cutting edge 
 
 








5 low ankle boots

 








 
example low ankle boots outfit
 







 
like ballet flats the time of low ankle boots has come and gone once skinny jeans and ankle boots were the power couple of the early 2010s now it s just what middleaged moms wear out to date night at cheesecake factory and there s nothing wrong with any of that but the ankle boot has also had a makeover  the shaft is higher the heel is thicker and the sole is chunkier the cheesecake factory regulars won t know what hit them
 
 





6 tight knee highotk boots






 
 
example otk boots look
 







 
i know skinny jeans and slim over the knee boots go together like peanut butter and jelly and they did  for years and years which is precisely why that particular combination will read as dated you can still keep both just change up the styling and don t pair them together knee high boots are back in style but instead of a 2010s slim riding boot it s a wider more generous cut with a chunkier sole the otk boots can also still be worn but rather with a mini skirtdress a slim midi skirt or a pair of winterweight shorts like leather or tweed 
 
 




7 graphic tees

 






 
example graphic tshirt look
 
 







if anything in your house or wardrobe says  live laugh love  i urge you to get rid of it immediately same with any saying related to coffee or the word  vibe  you ll thank me later 
 








now i m not saying you can t wear graphic tshirts with skinny jeans i m saying the type of graphic tshirt has changed a lot over the last 15 years the slim fit tiny sleeve crew neck tshirts with flowery etsy font is dead you can downgrade it to the shirts you wear when you re cleaning or painting so is the thin loose cropped 80s tshirt that says  bridesmaid  
 








instead an oversized and boxy or straight fit tshirt is the more modern and current option neither long nor short neither wide nor tight a comfortably loose tshirt with a regular short sleeve is a perfect basic nonoffensive choice for any woman of any age if it has to have a graphic make it a band tee not something that says  namaste  
 
 







 
8 big slouchy bags

 





 
example big purse outfit
 
 







the lv neverfull is a practical bag i know but wearing it with cropped skinny jeans and ballet flats looks like you re cosplaying christian girl autumn 10 years too late a canvas tote bag is a more modern choice or a sleek leather backpack you ve got both the comfort and the style for smaller bags and needs an uncertainshaped crossbody is also going to date your outfit try to be more intentional with the bag choice and shape something more structured with a top handle as well as a cross body strap is a fresher choice or a small perhaps embellished backpack
 
 






do this instead
 







i would like to first preface this by saying that you do not have to do all of these these are also not mandates they re options i picked a few different categories where updating other elements of your outfit can make skinny jeans feel less stale in 2023 something for everyone 
 




1 high waist

 




 
example highwaisted look

 





 
updating the rise is the easiest way to bring your skinnies into 2023 a higher rise gives you some new and modern styling options including tucking tops into your jeans or wearing tops that are more cropped  tshirts shirts blouses hoodies jackets  they all look better with a higher rise to balance out the silhouette high waisted jeans make your legs look longer they emphasize the waist and are comfortable to sit in since the waist should hit at your natural waist above your stomach and not cutting into it 
 
 






2 full length hems

 






 
example full length skinnies outfit
 








 
another style element that betrays the age of your skinny jeans is that outdated scrunched or cropped look this may very well be a matter of opinion but cropped skinny jeans don t work as well as other cropped styles because they re so tight it visually strangles your calf instead of highlighting the ankle and has the opposite effect the overly long scrunched look is not just outdated it s a sign your jeans don t fit well petites hem your skinny jeans  or buy the cropped ones as full length full length skinnies have a more streamlined look and work better with any type of shoe 
 
 








3 belts

 







 
example belted skinnies look
 










 
a high rise goes great with a belt both to highlight your waist  if that s the look you re after  and to serve as an extra accessory and styling device belting your jeans can tie in your shoes or bag in a nice way or it can visually break up a fit that needs a little extra somethingsomething be advised that belting a pair of pants that do not sit at your waist will emphasize your hips or stomach so if you re not keen on making that area seem wider then avoid belting andor tucking into mid or low rise bottoms
 
 








4 cropped cardigans

 







 
example boxy cardi look
 
 












it s time to let go of this weird notion that a cropped silhouette is only for 15 yearolds a cropped top shirt cardigan jacket etc is simply a change in silhouette and proportion and it does not  i repeat it does not mean that you re necessarily showing off your midriff or that it s a strictly  youthful  style 
 










the key to incorporating a cropped element is to pair it with high rise bottoms  in this case your skinnies styling them with an opposite style cardigan  short and bulky instead of long and thin  automatically freshens up the look and brings them into 2023 high rise  crop shirt is an excellent way to emphasize the waist or create an hourglass or pear silhouette like a belt the  break  in the outfit can be a much needed styling element to take the outfit from basic to stylish 
 
 












5 oversized blazers

 








 
example oversized blazer outfit
 
 








raise your hand if you wore skinny jeans low cut ankle boots and a blazer in 2010 i m not knocking it it s a good look but when worn all together it dates you but you can update the look by swapping out the blazer with a more current oversized style an oversized blazer vs a shorter slimmer fit one from the 2010s makes great contrast with the tightness of the pants and it gives the outfit a cooler slightly masculine edge while an alltight outfit can look a little tryhard an oversized element makes it a little cooler and more modern 
 
 
 






6 tucked in tops

 






 

example tucked in look
 

 








tucking is one of my favorite styling choices and i can t find much fault with it in fact it may very well make skinny jeans look modern like belts and crop tops tucking in a shirt achieves the same waist emphasis we re going for and it pulls away from the outdated lowrise  muffin top  long shirt look of the 2010s 
 
 







7 chunky shoes

 
 








example platform boots look
 
 







shoes can totally transform an outfit including taking it from 2013 to 2023 no one s trying to take away your heeled ankle boots but consider pairing those with a cropped straight leg instead and swap them out for a pair of chunky loafers or platform boot in a skinny jean outfit same with ballet flats let s mix and match trends and decades instead of doing the greatest hits of 2011 from head to toe 
 
 








8 voluminous tops
 







 
example voluminous top outfit
 
 











so we said no long tops  what do we do for  nice  tops instead there are a few different details that make for a modern top volume is one of the key words so a top that is short and boxy or that has voluminous sleeves or a voluminous collar etc very feminine corset tops are also very popular with or without sleeves or straps square necklines are extremely flattering on everyone and can be the one feature on an otherwise completely basic top that can have long sleeves or be tucked into the pants etc as for sweaters bulky wins over slim fitting for a modern look 
 
 










alternatives to skinny jeans
 
 










if you re ready to move on and see what else is out there then a world of new styles awaits you you ll be surprised at how much variety and excitement you can add to your wardrobe with one simple jean style swap the beautiful thing about transitional periods in fashion is that there s something for everybody there is no primary cut or style so you can find anything slim baggy wide leg bell bottoms bootcuts high rise low or mid it s all out there and you can make any of them work for you 
 










straight leg jeans
 








a good alternative are straight leg jeans and pants  the shape is not a huge departure from your usual while still being more modern straight leg jeans still allow for some of your longer tops to be worn without looking baggy from top to bottom you can still wear them with higher boots if you want and they re not very adventurous which means they re never the focus of the outfit itself 
 







they can play it safe and be quietly understated to support other more interesting design elements whether it s a big sleeve a bold color a collar a ruffle interesting buttons or other detailing on your top coat or accessories this style can still be successfully worn with a boxier or longer sweater for example without looking outdated 
 
 





example 
 






1  straight leg 1



2  straight leg 2




3  straight leg 3




4  straight leg 4





5  straight leg 5

An interesting post. I know Everlane is controversial here. Many have called out that their manufacturing ethics being kind of meh.

My own personal experience is my Everlane stuff has held up pretty darn well. I have a couple of linen tees (I always wash in a delicate bag) that I wear often, plus a boxy black sweatshirt and a merino sweatshirt that are two of my favorite items. I haven't bought a lot from them, but nothing has worn out or had fit issues.

That said, I wouldn't buy their cashmere or shoes. They seem really disposable and not meant to last, but I'm really just judging from their pictures and material details posted on the website.

femalefashionadvice,everlane,Everlane Choose What You Pay Scam :(,"Hi Everyone, 

I wanted to draw attention to the Choose What You Pay promotion that Everlane is running right now - and the fact that they're jacking up the price for some things, to only ""discount"" them even higher than they were originally being sold for. 

Full disclosure -  I love Everlane, and I have a lot of items from them. I love that they're an ethical retailer and that they treat their workers and factories well. But I would no longer call them ""transparent"" with their customers. 

Case in point - Their Nubuck Street Shoe in Taupe. I've had my eye on these pair of shoes for a long while now. They're $95, and not something that I'd pull the trigger on just like that - they're a big purchase! So when I saw that they were doing ""Choose What You Pay,"" I was eager to get a small discount on them, and Everlane rarely ever does discounts!

Just for the record as well - here's an [image](http://imgur.com/SFi9N7R) of the cached webpage (for some reason, it doesn't show nicely).


And here's what they're currently listing it as for their [Choose What You Pay Promotion.](https://www.everlane.com/collections/womens-shoes/products/womens-street-shoe-nubuck-taupe). And [here's](http://imgur.com/QR9d6na) an image.

Literally 2 days ago - I was about to buy these shoes at $95 original price. And now, they're ""discounting"" it. I wanted to give everyone a heads up before they fall for this promotion! Personally - I'm super disappointed and can no longer believe their ""transparency"" pitch.

femalefashionadvice,everlane,What I learned working in fast fashion eCommerce marketing,"I worked in marketing for fast fashion ecommerce brands over the past few years.

So they may not necessarily apply to _every_ brand out there.

**Catalog Images Always Use Clips**

Last year, [ASOS faced some heat](https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/asos-slammed-after-being-caught-out-using-clips-on-models-dress-9318265/) when they accidentally uploaded a catalog image that showed the garment being clipped on the model. This practice is the standard across eCommerce catalog shooting. The actual reason isn‚Äôt to mislead the customer (although that is unfortunately the outcome) but it‚Äôs due to the nature of the eCommerce new arrival cycle.

Typically, company HQ only receives 1 or maybe 2 samples of every item that they can use to photograph for catalog and campaign images. These samples arrive much earlier than bulk stock in order to be photographed ahead of release, and when bulk stock is finally ready, it goes straight to warehouses or retail stores in order to save on shipping costs. Brands tend to rotate through different models who have different heights, weights, and sizes - which means they‚Äôre often too small for the sample size. Without clips, the garment will usually look too baggy or loose and will not reflect the true fitting of the item so stylists clip the item on the body then photoshop them out during retouching.

That said, it‚Äôs a bit of a hard line to draw. Sometimes stylists clip it too tightly or too loosely (only designers really know how it‚Äôs supposed to fit and they aren‚Äôt usually involved in the photoshoot process) and the result can be misleading. 

------------------


**Every Influencer Post Is An Advertisement**

If an influencer tags a brand in their photo or in their caption, they most likely were paid to do so (either via cash or via free clothing). I know this isn‚Äôt necessarily ground-breaking news, but I want to explain the depth of the system.

Most brands have influencers on rotation. One of my previous companies had 150+ each month who they would send X articles of clothing and/or cash (depends on the influencer‚Äôs follower count and country) in return for Y number of posts or Stories (sometimes we would write the caption for them). We would track engagement and clothing sales spikes to see if it was worth it to keep them on. On our roster, we purposefully would have anyone from large scale celebrities down to micro-influencers (girls with less than 2k followers but had high engagement who had potential to grow - think popular university students) and everyone in between. Only influencers who were just starting out would post for us without us giving them anything for free because they wanted to align to our brand. Over 10k followers, never. 

So yes, it is great that Instagram rolled out the ‚ÄúPaid Partnership‚Äù feature that makes it easier to tell what is an ad or what isn‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs actually in both the brand and the influencer‚Äôs interest to avoid the Paid Partnership feature. Brands want the posts to seem organic (it‚Äôs not cool to have to pay to be featured) and influencers do not want their feed to be solely advertisements (it‚Äôs not cool to be a sell out). Influencers will mainly choose to do Paid Partnerships if the company isn‚Äôt good for their image or if the company has a lot of cash to spare.

This, I suspect, is why Instagram is getting rid of public like figures. If you do a Paid Partnership post, the influencer grants the brand access to the data metrics (how many likes, how many people saw it, etc;) which they desperately need to track in order to determine ROI. Furthermore, Paid Partnership posts also allow brands to put money behind the post and boost it as an ad that appears organic. It‚Äôs effectively another cash grab from IG.  But both brands and influencers will continue to skirt these regardless.

-----------------


**Everyone Copies Everyone‚Ä¶ and Korea**

Brands I worked for used [WGSN](https://www.wgsn.com/en/) for trend forecasting from runways and I know majority of others do as well. They basically collate all of high fashion‚Äôs runways into a few distilled core trends per season. This is why sometimes you‚Äôll see campaigns that are very similar from a number of brands at the same time. 

Competitor analysis is very, very real. Brands scrape competitor websites to figure out their inventory and determine if they have any gaps themselves. It is not uncommon to just straight up buy another brand‚Äôs garment and copy the pattern with slight adjustments.

This is particularly true when it comes to Dongdaemun, Seoul‚Äôs largest wholesale market. Lots of brands will either use patterns based off their inventory. Many others will actually just mark up, white label, and resell Korean wholesale market clothing. This is the case for Pixie Market (with the exception of their Made by Pixie Market section). Oh and those cheap accessories you see on fast fashion brands? Almost all of them are from Guangzhou in China.

--------------


**Greenwashing is Real**

If a fast fashion company is coming out with a CSR line, it‚Äôs not because they care about the environment. It‚Äôs because their PR department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being eco-friendly. And it‚Äôs because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends.

That‚Äôs not to say CSR collections are bad. By buying them, you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them. But unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand‚Äôs DNA from its onset, it is most likely just a marketing ploy. The same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching (you mean we can lay off our retouch team AND look woke? win fucking win).  

It‚Äôs worth noting that majority of brands share Asia factories with one another and conditions vary. China‚Äôs factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years, so as a result, a lot of companies are migrated to places like Cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper - so be mindful of those labels. 

For what it's worth, I met a guy who works for an IGO in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection. He told me that Inditex was one of the better ones but that H&M and Uniqlo had by far the worst.

if a fast fashion company is coming out with a csr line it s not because they care about the environment it s because their pr department told them it was a great idea to combat any claims of them not being ecofriendly and it s because their merchandisers told them it was a great idea to jump on consumer trends

that s not to say csr collections are bad by buying them you are encouraging the brand to continue to develop them but unless environmental sustainability and fair labour are embedded within the brand s dna from its onset it is most likely just a marketing ploy the same can be said for inclusivity campaigns and banning retouching you mean we can lay off our retouch team and look woke win fucking win  

it s worth noting that majority of brands share asia factories with one another and conditions vary china s factory conditions have actually improved significantly over the years so as a result a lot of companies are migrated to places like cambodia where conditions are more lenient and labor is cheaper  so be mindful of those labels 

for what its worth i met a guy who works for an igo in their fair labor division where his job was to raid clothing factories for inspection he told me that inditex was one of the better ones but that hm and uniqlo had by far the worst 



anyway i might be a bit cynical i love fashion but i didnt have the best experiences working in it im happy to answer any questions  but i will be avoiding any brandidentifying info for obvy reasons",Positive
femalefashionadvice,everlane,"Honest opinion of major minimalist clothing brands and a few lesser known ones (Everlane, COS, Uniqlo, APC etc)","Hi! This is my first time writing a post on reddit. I have been a long time lurker and have gotten many useful tips on fashion amongst other things here, so I thought it'd be nice to contribute to the community. Below is a list of some minimalist brands that I have personally shopped and my honest opinion about them, which may be quite different from what you read online. 

My personal style: I like clothes that are comfortable, made of natural materials and minimalist with a twist. I know many minimalists stick with true basics (t shirt + jeans) but I like to have a bit of design feature that stands out without being too over the top (not a huge fan of excessive lace, frills, leopard prints, neon colors or overly tight clothing). My favorite go-tos are shirts/blouses, skinny jeans/wide leg pants, blazers, trench coats and flats/loafers on most days. Quality is important to me as I like to keep my clothes for quite some time.

&#x200B;

**Review**:

[**COS**](https://www.cosstores.com/en_usd/index.html)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4.5/5

Fit: 3/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 4/5**

Their fabrics are of very good quality and their styles are minimalist but not boring. The price point is very reasonable considering the quality. I would wear 100% COS if only their stuff fits me a bit better. Unfortunately I find their styles to be unflattering on hourglass body shapes and I tend to look very bloated in styles that don't come in at the waist. That being said, I think their clothes would look amazing on someone who is less curvy.

&#x200B;

[**APC**](https://www.apc-us.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 3/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

Quality is great but can get a bit pricey. Personally I prefer a monochrome/simple neutral look and find their prints to be too busy. I also find their color palette to suit people with cool skin tone better. For these reasons it is not a great fit for me but may suit someone who prefer colorful prints and cool tone clothes. 

&#x200B;

[**Uniqlo**](http://uniqlo.com)

Quality: 3/5

Style: 3/5

Fit: 3/5

Price: 5/5

**Overall: 3.5/5**

Even though Uniqlo is recommended a lot on reddit, personally I have not had good luck with their items. I find their jeans and bras to lose shape quickly. Fabric on shirts is thin/flimsy and lost shape after one wash. Cashmere sweaters are quite thin and they feel more like merino wool than cashmere. Their pants are also quite short and would probably look a bit off on someone who is not petite. As a result, even though I like the price point I don't buy much from them.

I have also not had good luck with their heat tech line which is extremely popular. For me, they perform exactly as advertised, which is turning moisture from your body to heat. But I actually find this feature to be very uncomfortable because when do our bodies have lots of moisture? It is when we are sweating. So basically when I'm sitting idle and being really cold, it doesn't really do much, and when I'm out and about and sweating due to the movements, it turns those sweat into heat which causes me to sweat even more which turns into even more heat. Since it is worn as an under garment, it's not easy to take it off when you are out and about. And the end result is the feeling of baking in a pool of sweat, which I find quite unpleasant.

&#x200B;

[**Everlane**](https://www.everlane.com)

Quality: 3.5/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

I really love the ethics of Everlane and what it stands for but I wasn't impressed with its quality. I bought many t-shirts from them and had to return pretty much everything because they felt flimsy. The fabric was thin and the cotton was scratchy even though they were advertised as Pima Cotton. Put a t-shirt from COS and Everlane side by side and the difference in quality is night and day. Someone I knew bought a canvas backpack from them and the zipper broke after a month. The style and fit of their items are okay, but can look boxy on someone with curves. As much as I like their ""radical transparency"", I cannot support a brand that doesn't deliver on quality.

&#x200B;

[**Acne Studios**](https://www.acnestudios.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 2.5/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

The items from Acne Studios are great quality but their prints and bright colors are a bit much for me. It is just not a look I can pull off on a day-to-day basis. The price point is also a bit high for me personally so it's not a brand I shop frequently. 

&#x200B;

[**Madewell**](https://www.madewell.com)

Quality: 3/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 3.6/5**

A beloved brand by many but I'll have to be honest, I wasn't impressed with their quality at all. The cotton feels dry and scratchy and they use a lot of polyester. Honestly I feel like their quality is on par with fast fashion although the prices of the items are much higher. 

&#x200B;

[**Reformation**](https://www.thereformation.com)

Quality: 4/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 3.9/5**

Some of Reformation's dresses are really pretty and I also appreciate that they use natural and sustainable fabrics. That said, I think I'm getting a little too old to wear their body hugging styles and also their sizes tend to run very small. 

&#x200B;

**Now moving on to some lesser known brands:**

[**Mijeong Park**](https://mijeongpark.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4.5/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 4.1/5**

This is a lesser known brand that I found by a google search on minimalist brands. I immediately fell in love with their neutral colors and minimalist aesthetics. I like that they use quality and natural fabrics and the items I bought have held up very well after repeat wear. Their price point is higher than fast fashion but still very reasonable considering that it is from an independent designer and the quality of their items. My favorite items from them are fall sweaters and oversized wool coats. 

&#x200B;

[**SKYE**](https://shop-skye.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4.5/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 4.1/5**

If you like clothing that are feminine and minimalist with a twist, then I highly recommend SKYE. I absolutely love their minimal and elegant aesthetics. They also use quality and natural fabrics which are not only comfortable, but last through repeat wear. Most of their designs have belts or something that cinches in the waist so a curvier person like myself doesn't have to look bloated. At this point, half of my closet is from SKYE and I love that they offer free shipping and free returns. 

&#x200B;

[**Waltz Studio**](https://waltzstudio.com)

Quality: 4.5/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 3/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

Waltz uses quality fabrics and their items are made in California. As much as I enjoy the quality of their times, I do find their styles a bit challenging to wear either because of the cut or the color. Their price point is also a bit high but they do have sales occasionally. 

&#x200B;

[**Vetta**](https://www.vettacapsule.com)

Quality: 4/5

Style: 3.5/5

Fit: 3.5/5

Price: 4/5

**Overall: 3.75/5**

If you love capsule wardrobe comprised of basics, you should check out Vetta. Every season they come out with a few capsules consisting of 5 pieces that work together to form about 30 looks. I think the concept is genius. It makes getting dressed easy if you would just like to look presentable and don't care much for trends. For me personally their clothes can be a little on the shorter and boxier side (kinda like uniqlo) but they may look amazing on someone else. 

&#x200B;

[**AYR**](https://www.ayr.com/)

Quality: 4/5

Style: 4/5

Fit: 4/5

Price: 3.5/5

**Overall: 3.9/5**

If you love minimal shirts and jeans, then AYR is for you. I like their use of natural, quality fabrics. They are best known for their denim although I've had good luck with their shirts and dresses as well. Prices are higher than fast fashion but still reasonable considering the quality of the items. 

&#x200B;

These are some of the brands that I have personally shopped and I continue to shop from some of them. Please keep in mind that this is purely my personal opinion, and things may have changed since I last bought from them.

femalefashionadvice,everlane,Everlane Modern Ankle Boot Review,"[Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/hOx5J) 

Hi all!

There seemed to be interest in a review of the Everlane Modern Ankle Boot in the Simple Questions thread today, so I thought I would share my experience. I checked my order history today and it looks like my shoes were delivered just a hair over three weeks ago, so this review is based on 3 weeks of wear. (I originally ordered an 8 and had to size up to the 8.5, but received the 8.5 the three weeks ago.) 

First, I will say that these boots are gorgeous. Like, several strangers have stopped me in NYC to ask me about my shoes gorgeous. The leather is very nice and buttery, and the stitching is well done. They‚Äôre definitely sleek. 

BUT 

I am really disappointed in how quickly they‚Äôve worn down. As you can see in the images, the outside sole on the heel has already worn through the rubber. I‚Äôve worn them probably 5x/week over the last three weeks, and I do walk more than the average non-city-dweller, but‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs three weeks of wear on a pair of $200 shoes. The outside part of the sole has also shown a lot of wear from my walking around. 

The boots themselves also scuff really easily, which is I think due to the leather. 

I was a bit thrown at first by how large they look. Compared to my other shoes (and even compared to my other ankle boots) they look at least 1-2 sizes larger because of the pointed toe. I got over this after about a week and a half, but if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre worried about, I would keep it in mind. 

There aren‚Äôt any zippers or anything, so to put them on you have to pull apart the top and force your foot in. I haven‚Äôt found a way to do it without forcing down the back of the shoe a bit, and it‚Äôs causing creasing. It‚Äôs also led to a constant battle to put the shoes on‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried everything from standing up to sitting down to laying on the floor and pulling. Also sticking things in the back didn‚Äôt help much either. 

The inside of the shoe is pretty flat and doesn‚Äôt offer much support (about on par with most ballet flats). The website says to size down ¬Ω size. I typically wear an 8 or an 8.5 because the front of my foot is slightly wide at the front, and I ended up going with the 8.5 after trying both on. They‚Äôve stretched a bit. I tried on the Modern Loafer at an event they had in NYC once, and I found that the loafer was much more narrow than these.

Overall, I still love the look, but now I‚Äôm afraid to keep wearing them because the heel is so worn and low-quality. I also am pissed that I spent so much money on them for them to wear out in less than a month. 

I'd say it's worth it if you have $200 to spend, don't do a lot of outside walking, and want a sleek, minimalist ankle boot. Otherwise, if you want something that will be really durable, there are probably better options out there. 


EDIT: customer service emailed me back after I contacted them and basically said I was SOL because ""heel wear will occur naturally"" and to try taking them to a cobbler. Do not recommend.

EDIT 2: /u/brandonfromeverlane followed up with my email to customer service and offered a partial refund. The cobbler was able to fix the heel relatively easily, and they look a lot better after getting repaired. If you're considering them, I'd say definitely take them to a cobbler from the beginning to get a different sole on the shoe.

femalefashionadvice,everlane,Linen Shirt Comparison,"It's linen season and I've spent far too much time searching for the right linen shirt for me so I've made a breakdown of all the linen shirts I've tried so far. Throwaway in case of creeps

**My Sizing:**

* Usually a 12/L but will often have to size up to a 14/XL in tighter fitting clothes due to large bust

**My criteria:**

* Classic button up shirt
* Only 100% linen, no blends
* Pure white color, no off whites
* Would prefer as opaque as possible; wore a black tank top underneath to help evaluate sheerness
* While I am probably never going to wear it fully buttoned up, I would like the option of being able to and not having it gape at the bust

**Disclaimers**:

* I am NOT a fabric/sewing expert. Heck I'm not even a novice. I tried learning to sow during one summer and my mom straight up gave up on me. Most criteria here is going to be very subjective. I've added links to imgur pictures so you can decide for yourself how accurate my conclusions are
* You may also be asking u/chickenparmtruffle , isn't this a bit much for a clothing item that's supposed to be an easy breezy option? And to that I answer, yes. Yes it is. Please shame me. I should be applying for grad schools right now.
* When I was shopping, Quince was out of stock of their white shirts so I ordered a black one to test their quality. I was able to order a white linen pant of theirs so I compared the sheerness to the pants instead as it's easier to compare white to white

**Variables I looked at:**

* Weight: Weighted all size large shirts. This obviously will not account for differences in finishing, buttons, etc. but gives a pretty good idea on weave quality & sheerness
* Price: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 >$100 and/or usually never goes on sale
   * 2 $100>x>$50 and/or goes on sale
   * 3 >$50 goes on sale often
* Sheerness: Scored on a scale of 1-3.
   * 1 is you can see underwear
   * 2 you can kinda see underwear depending on the lighting
   * 3 as opaque as linen gets
* Gaping at bust: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 would not feel comfortable going outside as a regular button up
   * 2 some gaping, would potentially be okay going outside as a regular button up but would absolutely need to wear something underneath
   * 3 no gaping would wear to work
* Button Hole finishing: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 button holes not finished or very poorly done
   * 2 some fibers are coming out of the button hole making it slightly annoying to button and unbutton
   * 3 button holes are finished well
* Construction: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 it's 2 seconds away from falling apart
   * 2 some loose threads, some seams are not finished well
   * 3 construction is nice and tidy
* General Fit/Drape: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 I don't know why but I hate how it looks on me
   * 2 I like it but it's not perfect
   * 3 Perfect no notes
* Order of Pictures in each album:
   * Front unbuttoned
   * Back unbuttoned
   * Side unbuttoned
   * Front buttoned
   * Side buttoned

**Conclusions:**

* I will do literally anything to avoid applying for grad school
* I could never make it as a content creator. This is so much work

**Conclusions Actually Related to the Shirts**

* A fairly obvious observation but I found that the heavier the weight, the closer the weave was and the less sheer the shirt was
* Maybe I just don't know the difference between good linen and great linen, but I felt that all the shirts felt very similar. The Athleta and the Tommy Bahama stood out as feeling the softest and the Muji one was the scratchiest but overall very similar. I also imagine with washes the shirts will get to be around the same softness
* Brooks Brothers and J Crew sourced their linen from the same brand Baird McNutt Irish linen. I do think the J Crew one was a tad less see through and fit slightly better on me but other than that I don't think the additional $40 (usually more since J Crew does a lot of sales) is worth it
* I *love* the mother of pearl buttons on the Tommy Bahama shirt and am tempted to keep it just for that. However it is $118 vs $39.90/54.90 for Quince/Muji
* The Athleta one surprised me with how thick it is. It almost felt like I was wearing a light flannel.
* While sizing up really helped when I buttoned up the shirts, it made me look frumpy when the shirt was left open. As I am most likely going to wear it as a cardigan, I decided to consider the overall drape first

**Which one am I keeping?**

Great question. Personally I like how the J Crew size 12 fits the most. However the cost is a bit much to justify so I'm potentially leaning towards keeping the Quince and/or the Uniqlo ones and waiting to see if the J Crew one goes on sale.

**Are you going to test any other linen shirts?**

I was originally planning to. Some of the brands I was looking at were:

* J. Jill
* J. McLauglin
* Orvis
* Ralph Lauren
* AYR
* Madewell
* COS
* Lands' End
* Abercrombie
* Lilly Pulitzer

But after doing this, I realized that it's a lot of work taking photos, editing and writing this all up and I don't know if I'll be up for a part 2. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. Peer pressure works on me

However, I have already bought a bunch of linen pants to compare so I'll definitely make a write up of that soon.",1750968318.0,"Linen Shirt Comparison It's linen season and I've spent far too much time searching for the right linen shirt for me so I've made a breakdown of all the linen shirts I've tried so far. Throwaway in case of creeps

**My Sizing:**

* Usually a 12/L but will often have to size up to a 14/XL in tighter fitting clothes due to large bust

**My criteria:**

* Classic button up shirt
* Only 100% linen, no blends
* Pure white color, no off whites
* Would prefer as opaque as possible; wore a black tank top underneath to help evaluate sheerness
* While I am probably never going to wear it fully buttoned up, I would like the option of being able to and not having it gape at the bust

**Disclaimers**:

* I am NOT a fabric/sewing expert. Heck I'm not even a novice. I tried learning to sow during one summer and my mom straight up gave up on me. Most criteria here is going to be very subjective. I've added links to imgur pictures so you can decide for yourself how accurate my conclusions are
* You may also be asking u/chickenparmtruffle , isn't this a bit much for a clothing item that's supposed to be an easy breezy option? And to that I answer, yes. Yes it is. Please shame me. I should be applying for grad schools right now.
* When I was shopping, Quince was out of stock of their white shirts so I ordered a black one to test their quality. I was able to order a white linen pant of theirs so I compared the sheerness to the pants instead as it's easier to compare white to white

**Variables I looked at:**

* Weight: Weighted all size large shirts. This obviously will not account for differences in finishing, buttons, etc. but gives a pretty good idea on weave quality & sheerness
* Price: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 >$100 and/or usually never goes on sale
   * 2 $100>x>$50 and/or goes on sale
   * 3 >$50 goes on sale often
* Sheerness: Scored on a scale of 1-3.
   * 1 is you can see underwear
   * 2 you can kinda see underwear depending on the lighting
   * 3 as opaque as linen gets
* Gaping at bust: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 would not feel comfortable going outside as a regular button up
   * 2 some gaping, would potentially be okay going outside as a regular button up but would absolutely need to wear something underneath
   * 3 no gaping would wear to work
* Button Hole finishing: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 button holes not finished or very poorly done
   * 2 some fibers are coming out of the button hole making it slightly annoying to button and unbutton
   * 3 button holes are finished well
* Construction: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 it's 2 seconds away from falling apart
   * 2 some loose threads, some seams are not finished well
   * 3 construction is nice and tidy
* General Fit/Drape: Scored on a scale of 1-3
   * 1 I don't know why but I hate how it looks on me
   * 2 I like it but it's not perfect
   * 3 Perfect no notes
* Order of Pictures in each album:
   * Front unbuttoned
   * Back unbuttoned
   * Side unbuttoned

femalefashionadvice,everlane,Everlane Modern Oxford after one wear: A kinda review / Is This Normal?,"EDIT: Fraying on the sides was definitely from a plastic cover that I wasn't aware of. After peeling it off the damage doesn't look as bad - there's definitely still some chipping on the heel but the fraying is definitely from the plastic. So I feel kinda dumb but I was just freaking out. Thanks FFA. 

I recently purchased Everlane's Modern Oxford and hadn't seen it mentioned anywhere recently! So I wanted to provide a small review as reference and get some feedback on what constitutes normal wear-and-tear since this is my first pair of leather ""fancier"" shoes. I know Everlane has gained a lot of traction on this sub and that played a huge factor as to why I chose this brand for some new kicks.

My first impression of these shoes were great! They were the perfect addition to upgrade my business casual wardrobe into something a little sleeker/smarter. I had some standard heel pain breaking them in today, but the leather is really soft. The shoe is also REALLY pointy at the toe, which I'm not really used to, but it looks great on. I have a fairly wide foot and these shoes fit my regular size perfectly. 

However, after wearing them all day I noticed there was a LOT of wear-and-tear on the stacked sole. Some creasing on the top of the leather, but that was to be expected (For reference, I work all day in a carpeted office, and walked only a few blocks outside on some uneven pathways). I took some reference photos here:

[ REGULAR WEAR AND TEAR ?](http://imgur.com/a/DJbCT)

As you can see, the sides of the sole are fraying really heavily. It almost feels plastic-y, or like it's shedding off. There's some chips already on the heels too, which I thought was unusual and somewhat disappointing. My brother has a pair of $40 leather shoes that he's had for a year and he destroys everything, and his soles don't look like mine at all.

Now I have some doubts about the quality of this purchase. I'm not sure if this is justifiable to contact customer service, but wanted to see if anyone else can verify if this is normal for this kind of shoe or if there is something actually wrong with the sole.

Thank you FFA ya'll rock!

There's some chips already on the heels too, which I thought was unusual and somewhat disappointing. My brother has a pair of $40 leather shoes that he's had for a year and he destroys everything, and his soles don't look like mine at all.

Now I have some doubts about the quality of this purchase. I'm not sure if this is justifiable to contact customer service, but wanted to see if anyone else can verify if this is normal for this kind of shoe or if there is something actually wrong with the sole.

Thank you FFA ya'll rock! 
","everlane modern oxford after one wear a kinda review  is this normal edit fraying on the sides was definitely from a plastic cover that i wasnt aware of after peeling it off the damage doesnt look as bad  theres definitely still some chipping on the heel but the fraying is definitely from the plastic so i feel kinda dumb but i was just freaking out thanks ffa 

i recently purchased everlanes modern oxford and hadnt seen it mentioned anywhere recently so i wanted to provide a small review as reference and get some feedback on what constitutes normal wearandtear since this is my first pair of leather fancier shoes i know everlane has gained a lot of traction on this sub and that played a huge factor as to why i chose this brand for some new kicks

my first impression of these shoes were great they were the perfect addition to upgrade my business casual wardrobe into something a little sleekersmarter i had some standard heel pain breaking them in today but the leather is really soft the shoe is also really pointy at the toe which im not really used to but it looks great on i have a fairly wide foot and these shoes fit my regular size perfectly 

however after wearing them all day i noticed there was a lot of wearandtear on the stacked sole some creasing on the top of the leather but that was to be expected for reference i work all day in a carpeted office and walked only a few blocks outside on some uneven pathways i took some reference photos here

femalefashionadvice,everlane,Has anyone owned the Everlane loafers for more than a year?,"Hi FFA!

So I'm really tired of shoes falling apart. I really want to buy a pair of comfortable, durable shoes that are versatile. As a college student the Everlane loafers are quite expensive, but I feel as if they could be worth it if they last. I live in New York City so I walk a lot, so think often and heavy wear on pavement. I want to wear these to my internship, going out, as well as school settings.

I've seen the shoes in person at the Everlane shoe park (which was rather cool!) and they seemed pretty nice in person, but what I want to know is if they last! So has anyone owned them for over a year with regular use have any input?

femalefashionadvice,everlane,So I tried Everlane tees...,"Hi FFA!

After reading the many ""perfect t-shirt"" threads, I decided to give Everlane a try. I wanted something machine-washable, so ruled out the Ryan shirts although I know many of you swear by them. I ended up getting a large women's V-neck in white, a large women's box-cut tee in white, and a small men's crew neck in slate. I am 5'9"", 155 lbs, normally a size 8-10, and wear a 34B. I have a hard time finding good t-shirts because of my broad shoulders (grrrr cap sleeves!).

So how did they fit?

* Large women's V-neck: Awful - the V ended almost under my breasts, and the shoulders were cut narrowly. It was also very long and fairly sheer, the kind of white shirt where the hems are opaque but not much else.

* Large women's box-cut tee: Fine, I guess. A reasonable length with wider sleeves. Cute pocket. I felt like I was swimming in it though, it had a strange bulky look to it. Shoulders better.

* Small men's crew-neck: Perfect! Shoulders exactly right, even a little big, nice slim fit throughout the torso, great color. Crew neck didn't sit too high either. It's a little longer than I usually like, but that helps it sit well without riding up.

I've returned the two women's shirts and ordered a men's V-neck. 

TL;DR If you have broader shoulders and don't want a plunging V, give the men's shirts a try!

UPDATE:

* Everlane men's small V-neck: Very long, oddly boxy in shoulders, V fairly shallow. Liked the color and comfort, so kept it, but I don't see myself wearing it that often. 

* Everlane women's medium U-neck: Nice drape, not too long. My new favorite of the Everlane t-shirts, which I wouldn't have thought from their photos. Thanks for the tip /u/lgbtqbbq!

* Uniqlo women's medium modal linen t-shirt: Fantastic fit, drapes well, and feels nice. Comes in a variety of good neutrals, however, every color is see-through. Yes, even the darker ones.

* Uniqlo women's medium supima cotton round neck short sleeve t-shirt: As far as I can tell, pretty much identical to the Everlane U-neck. Material seems a little thinner and shinier (a lot of Uniqlo cotton is shiny, why?). Comes in a nice grey and a whole bunch of more difficult pastels.",1399146918.0,"So I tried Everlane tees...

femalefashionadvice,everlane,Everlane: quick and dirty review,"Tl;dr: white silk shirt and white v-neck tee review, now with photos.

I placed my order on the same day Everlane relaunched the silk shirts, but as I live in Asia and Everlane wouldn't take my card, had to order and ship through a concierge. My silk shirt and v-neck tee are finally here, and I've got some comments accompanied by some not-so-great photos that hopefully will help those on the fence about purchasing. 

(If this isn't appropriate - MFA has had some reviews, but this would be the first one in FFA - please let me know and I'll put it in the right place.)



***Silk shirt***: S, White, Rounded Collar

Initially I wanted to buy two items: the white and black silk shirts. Well, the black ran out of stock in the time it took the concierge to process my order (5 days... ...), and so I ended up with only one silk shirt, the classic white with the rounded collar. Turns out, I was lucky, because... 

The S is **oversize** on me, although I expected it to fit according to the measurements given. True enough, my shirt measures 19.5"" PTP (see measurements album), although it's supposed to fit a 32-34"" bust. 

The sleeves also run a little long (25""), which is a pity because I would've liked the option to wear it without cuffing the sleeves at work. 

Shoulders are about 16"", which is great.

Since I work in a conservative environment, and the white is not *just* slightly sheer (see photo), I will have to wear a cami underneath.

Nevertheless, I'm in love. Why? 

* The silk is dense, and drapes beautifully. I based my purchase on [les anti-modernes*](http://www.lesantimodernes.com/2013/04/foundations-spring-uniform.html)'s review where she compared the silk to Equipment, and while I cannot comment on the accuracy of that comparison, it is indeed of very good quality, and blows my other silk shirts (Gat Rimon, River Island, Juicy Couture) out of the water price/value wise.
* It's so versatile - business casual as a blouse, business formal under a suit, smart casual with jeans and heeled sandals, walking the dog with shorts and Birkenstocks. 

Sizing wise, I might experiment with XS or complain to Everlane, but once that's worked out, I'll likely buy more shirts in other colours.



***V-neck tee***: S, White

I love this tee. It's a little too long for me, but very comfortable. I have a LOT of basics in all sorts of materials, basics aren't hard to find here where it's so hot that no one really wears anything... (kidding) but I think I might actually buy some more of these *if* this piece lasts. The white is slightly sheer, but the cotton is dense, and has a much better handfeel than my other basics.

It'll probably cost as much or more in shipping to return the shirt as it does to alter the item on my own, so I cannot return these items - and I knew this when I clicked that Buy button. Fortunately I wasn't disappointed this time, and am now eyeing the belts and cashmere sweaters.

i love this tee its a little too long for me but very comfortable i have a lot of basics in all sorts of materials basics arent hard to find here where its so hot that no one really wears anything kidding but i think i might actually buy some more of these if this piece lasts the white is slightly sheer but the cotton is dense and has a much better handfeel than my other basics

itll probably cost as much or more in shipping to return the shirt as it does to alter the item on my own so i cannot return these items  and i knew this when i clicked that buy button fortunately i wasnt disappointed this time and am now eyeing the belts and cashmere sweaters

femalefashionadvice,everlane,I kept an Excel spreadsheet of my wardrobe for 8 years and these are my results,"**Note: I updated the post to include medians so that newer items do not skew my results. I also included the screenshot of my Excel template and a downloadable template. See bottom of post.** 

\------------------------------

In one of the previous posts regarding quality clothing, someone asked for recommendations on quality brands that are worth the money.  I have been keeping track of my wardrobe for 8 years, including brand, type of clothes, cost, cost per wear (CPW) how many times I've worn the item, and the last time I've worn the item. As I donate, sell, or discard the clothes, I remove the item from my list.

**Background**: I'm in my late 20s /early 30s and have switched between outdoorsy science-related jobs to indoor office-based jobs. My wardrobe is a mix of both casual and business casual clothes. My income was modest for many years and my career only kicked off recently. From the start of my Excel inventory, I bought mostly from mall-brand clothing. I recently began investing in more office-appropriate clothing and perceived higher-quality brands. This skews my CPW up for certain categories.

I've been trying to buy more quality items over quantity and will be more mindful of my purchases in the future. It'd be interesting to see how my spreadsheet evolves over the years and compare which brands had items with the longest duration in my closet and lowest CPW.

&#x200B;

**Brands most donated and henceforth excluded from Excel:** *Old Navy, Forever 21, H&M, Zara* \--> Most of these clothes had a life span of 2 months to 2 years in my closet. They lose their shape and color fairly quickly compared to other brands. These brands were excluded from my Cost Per Wear Analysis because I had gotten rid of so many clothes from those brands.

&#x200B;

**Here is what I found based on type of clothing:**

&#x200B;

**Other observations**:

* Anthropologie was not worth it at all for me. I bought two dresses on a whim and wear them only once to a wedding.
* American Eagle was pretty worth it for me. Their items have a long duration in my closet and they have a low CPW.
* Banana Republic items last a long time in my closet but the CPW is high. It indicates to me that I don't love their clothing style and don't wear their items enough.
* Items that I had bought from subscription services (i.e. StitchFix) have really poor CPW. I felt compelled to only keep the items only to avoid the styling fee and I did not end up loving the items.
* The median CPW indicates that everyday outerwear, t-shirts, and sweaters had the longest duration in my closet and lowest CPW in my closet. On the other hand, special occasion bags and outerwear had the highest CPW.
* Fast fashion is not worth it. While some items remain in my closet for years, the majority were donated after 3 months to 2 years of wearing.  Again, donated, sold, and discarded items were excluded from my analysis.

**Future Predictions**: Over the next few years, I think I will donate most of my fast fashion items. CPW from brands like MM LaFleur (of which I will have heavy work-outfit rotations) will decrease in CPW but stand the test of time.

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is helpful for anyone. I'm really curious to see how my Excel progresses as I move away from fast-fashion and more towards quality items. I also wonder if my analysis correlates with other's perception of the brands listed.

femalefashionadvice,everlane,What trends do you predict for the 2020s?,"I‚Äôm sure this has been asked before, but a search didn‚Äôt show anything in the last year, so I thought it was worth asking again.

Here are my thoughts. (I am nowhere close to an expert, would love to hear opposing views!):

- a continued rise in ethical fashion, either with more eco friendly fabrics or a general push to buy less or buy secondhand

- increase in maximalist and over the top silhouettes and styles. 

This might just be my personal hope, sparked from Villanelle‚Äôs outfits on Killing Eve.

As I‚Äôve gotten older, gotten into my groove with my personal style, and as I‚Äôve started to make more money, I‚Äôve tried buying more expensive clothing with the idea of having ‚Äúfewer but better‚Äù items...but I just can‚Äôt help coming back to my old, affordable (for me) standbys. I either don‚Äôt like the items as much, or I don‚Äôt notice a discernible difference in quality to where I think it‚Äôs a good value for my money. I‚Äôm also pretty much exclusively shopping online right now due to the pandemic, so it‚Äôs harder to tell if an item is really worth the higher price tag without seeing the quality in person, being able to try on, etc. 

For example, I wanted to invest in a good pair of jeans recently, and after reading lots of reviews, carefully taking my measurements, really thinking about my decision...I bought a new pair of jeans from GRLFRND for about $100 on sale. I picked a pair of 100% cotton jeans with the idea of ‚Äúfewer but better‚Äù/‚Äúbuy it for life‚Äù in mind, but when I got these jeans in the mail & tried them on...I hated them. They technically ‚Äúfit‚Äù but they were so uncomfortable and unflattering. I guess these are the kinds of jeans I need to ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt work for me.

I have a few old items from The Gap and J Crew which I purchased over 10 years ago that still hold up nicely, that are well-stitched, made of high-quality fabric, etc... the last time I got new items from these stores I was disappointed to find they pretty much felt like Forever 21 quality to me. I‚Äôm personally bummed because I can finally afford whatever I want from these stores but the quality has gone downhill.

femalefashionadvice,everlane,My Wide Foot Manifesto (With Recs!),"I'm posting this on a few commented suggestions from my previous post on Rothy's Dupes.

&#x200B;

I'm a 5 foot 4 inches woman, 140 lbs, with a larger bust. I'm also, not ""ideally shaped"". Meaning I am familiar with the constant search for the ""short"" length, the slim ""petite"" selections, and the white whale ""wide width"" shoe. As a result, I am *constantly* shopping for clothes that actually fit. Yes, it's fun, but finding something that truly fits has been an uphill battle since day zero (I'm a programmer, [we start arrays at zero](https://xkcd.com/163/)!). So, me and my pizza shaped feet have been On. A. Mission. To find the ideal wide shoe. (*Spoiler*: The ideal shoe [were the friends we found along the way](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72F0Bvsi8CLuY5KE/giphy.gif)).

Okay, here are the things to know:

# The Bad Wide Shoe Traits

Here are things I've experienced with wide shoes that, well, suck. Some of these also apply to our Narrow sisters as well!

1. **Fewer Options (color/styles)**
   1. Wide shoes aren't typically made in all the colors and models for each shoe. Simply because we're not the ""key demographic"" according to the makers, and try to cover us while making a decent overhead. It is annoying because I cannot buy a pair of red shoes without significant effort. A person who isn't can't do that.
   2. [Exhibit A](https://imgur.com/vnasrmE): ""Pumps Women"" unfiltered search on DSW
      1. This is a set of sexy stilettos. The SEO here is like, ""oh yeah, firey hot red sexy lady party, rock on. Go out on the town, go the clubs. Party. Meet a sexy person, be sexy, take a sexy selfie, oh, ah, oh ah, only at mattress giant. This is great, want it in red? GET IT IN RED YOU SEXY PERSON YOU. YES. FIERCE, [BLUE STEEL](https://media.giphy.com/media/X9RBixlR36Uco/giphy.gif), VOGUE, GO GO YES, INTO THE CAMERA, MAKE LOVE TO THE CAMERA.""
   3. [Exhibit B](https://imgur.com/tklIq6N): Filtered to Wide
      1. This set of shoes is reserved for the shaded area of a Venn diagram consisting of matronly knitting, and [community](https://media.giphy.com/media/gQsfOW387X9Hq/giphy.gif) college business course photos with just the right amount of diverse representation.
2. **Settling for Floppy/Hurtful Shoes**
   1. The shoes I've gotten ""close enough"" to fitting, flop a lot on the end of it. What happens is I buy a shoe that fits at the ball of my foot, so it ""stays"". However, when I step up, the back of the heel flops. However, I am at a corporate job so I *need* a pair of black heels, and I have a meeting on Monday morning. So you end up buying the pair of shoes, and basically powering through until they're ""broken in"" or you throw them out. This is doubly terrible for heels because you will fall on your bum!
3. **They're Expensive**
   1. Typically they're not only tougher to find, but more expensive. As with any specialty sizing, like petite sizing, they cost more. The brands serve a smaller market, and so they try to either make their money back (or understand we're willing to pay) by asking for more. In addition, if there is a shoe you *really* love, you try to make it work by stretching or adding pads. This also are more costs and time for one pair of shoes.
   2. Note: I, for one am VERY WILLING to shell out cash for great shoes that fit. I just.. haven't found any!
4. **They're Only Online**
   1. Like any specialty sizing, they're typically more options only online. That means it's a gamble when you order if it *actually* fits. You usually have to order two, only to find both don't work (figures!). Then you have to do the return dance which sucks.
5. **Foot Condoms**
   1. Okay, this is a major pet peeve for me. Most, if not all women, own what I refer to as a ""foot condom"". These are those weirdo [scrunchy shoes](https://www.amazon.com/Ollio-Womens-Shoes-Comfort-Ballet/dp/B07978X8NM/ref=cts_sh_3_vtp) that leaves nothing to the imagination, and arch up when not worn.
      1. What are they? They are little tiny wisps of fabric that are glued to your foot like a trash bag was vacuumed around your big ass toes. Nothing is left to the imagination. No your toe cleavage may not be showing, but the other feet sure as hell knows when your feet are in a cold space or feelin' frisky (watch out for foot matching dances). They also have the shoe thickness of those slices of tomato they show on the home shopping network where they're selling high quality Japanese knives for 80 easy payments of 4 cents and need to read the newspaper through a fruit. You have no protections against mini potholes, Arctic conference rooms, or [upcoming corporate singularity with these shoes](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IylOPCNkiqOgMyA/giphy.gif). However, they *are* perfect for your upcoming costume part in Bath for Jane Austen day, and look! They have a cute little bow that will annoy and bounce. How [quaint](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JdZUPzYZ3cL1fFK/giphy.gif)!
      2. I hate them, BUT I end up owning 14 pairs. Why? They are the best fit for the weirdest feet. As a result, even though I think they're kind of ugly and don't work, and *I need some goddess damn black flats for* [work](https://media.giphy.com/media/w3RhszxPfflAs/giphy.gif) you settle for them.
6. **Harder to ""tailor"" shoes**
   1. While in some cases it may work, it is much harder to tailor a shoe versus a piece of clothing. As a [short](https://reductress.com/post/man-love-tiny-woman-because-she-make-feel-big/) person, I can tailor my skirts or my shirts. But, getting my shoes widened, and shortened is much harder to get done. I usually have to find a shoe hospital, or similar. It's easier to find a local dry cleaner that tailors than a shoe place.

# Know your official size, and if you're wide

The easiest way is to get out a ruler and put your foot on it (many prefer to draw around your foot on a paper on the ground then compare that). Then go to [this site](http://www.sizecharter.com/clothing-fit-and-measurement/understanding-shoe-sizing) and check your length, and your width. I am the length of a US 7, and the width of a 7.5 W. So I'm too short and wide. Considering my [hot slice of a pizza](https://media.giphy.com/media/6EncNPTYts8lq/giphy.gif) body, this matches. However, most of my shoes are closer to 7 or 7.5 as I often find it's easier to stretch a shoe then shorten it.

# What ""other things"" can I do to make my shoes fit better?

There are a few things to expand your options. Sadly, all of them require you to spend more cash. But, here ya go:

* **Get a** [**Shoe Stretcher**](https://www.amazon.com/Eachway-Professional-Premium-Stretcher-Adjustable/dp/B01NAKQEBL/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=shoe+stretcher&qid=1564278621&s=gateway&sr=8-3)
   * I stretch all my shoes for 24 hr (per shoe) before I buy. As I have a more short than wide foot, I end up buying a size down and trying to stretch it.
* **Buy Ankle** [**Pads**](https://www.amazon.com/Heel-Cushion-Inserts-Prevention-Protectors/dp/B07GXHT6GR/ref=sr_1_23?keywords=shoe+pads&qid=1564278732&s=gateway&sr=8-23)
   * If you buy a shoe that fits your width, but *not* your ankle, you usually get a lot of ""flops"". You can add pads that sit inside the ankle. However these I typically have issues with. I end up having a large gap between where my ankle top hits the pad, and the bottom half doesn't. That leaves room for slipping around if I go in funny angles (which is... [often](https://media.giphy.com/media/TfKfqjt2i4GIM/giphy.gif).)
* **Get your shoe adjusted**
   * You'd have to find a place in town that does this. It's very hit or miss per city, and typically costs over $50. I wouldn't recommend this for the average shoe. I did find an [online place](https://www.myshoehospital.com/), but I haven't tried it.

Frankly... these are about it. If your shoe doesn't fit, it's either this o[r live with it.](https://media.giphy.com/media/oFI7FttD0iC8V2Iqmy/giphy.gif)

# Shoe Features to Avoid In Standard Sizing

&#x200B;

* **Strict mid ball straps** ([Example](https://www.amazon.com/MVE-Shoes-Womens-Single-Joana-1/dp/B07V3NMK58/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=strap+heels&qid=1564280919&s=gateway&sr=8-5))
   * This is very hit or miss. If there is a strap right across the ball of the foot, it might be the perfect width if you size up, but that only works if you got a *very* adjustable ankle strap. If you do, it works out nicely since you just size up and adjust that. If you don't, then you end up just rubbing up against it like a [dog in heat](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/190/cover.jpg).
* **Peep Toe**
   * Usually I never have the right foot to length ratio to make my foot cleavage make all the foot boys come to my foot yard.
* **Mules**
   * These are shoes that are ""covered"" in the front half but not the back. They just never really work. What ends up happening is a flip flop, but it hits your heel with the intensity of more cowbell. It isn't worth the loud [slapping](https://media.giphy.com/media/1zgOyLCRxCmV5G3GFZ/giphy.gif).
* **Canvases with no stretch**
   * Sometimes this is fine, but if you're wide you typically search for the stretchiest shoe material (See my foot condom rant) for a reason. The downside of it stretching to fit you is that the foot will spill over the sides or front, leaving it unprotected from the ground. This can lead to back issues. See Naomi Small's [season 8 entrance look](https://external-preview.redd.it/7bgA1Bn27pwwWiRU6L6XwSQ94O210ZwFH7BV61W-70o.jpg?width=1200&height=628.272251309&auto=webp&s=7a54909628fe451100056e1ca699eb61e01f64ac).

&#x200B;

# Signs a Shoe May Work Out!

* **A very adjustable ankle strap, or elastic back.** Lets you have a wide front but will fit your ""narrower"" to width ratio ankle
   * [Example](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-day-heel-brightred?collection=womens-heels)
* **Stretcher Canvas.** Like I said before, this does lead to a spill over, but this might work if the shoe sole bottom is wide enough. This is why knit flats are so popular.
   * [Example](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/skechers-cleo-flat/420522?activeColor=017&rrec=true)
* **If it... comes is a wide size!**! Okay, this one is a given
* **Not a stiff pointed toe.** This one sucks to write because I'm basically saying that a certain style won't be in your wheel house, and I love this type. However, what happens is the pointed toe goes from wide to point too quickly, and you end up either a) having a real awkward bulge in your shoe, that you may need to cover with a [binder in middle school](https://media.giphy.com/media/14dXclYKbx2ONW/giphy.gif), or b) it pinches and hurts.
* **Lots of Non Ankle Straps.** My favorite shoes tend to be ones that ""hold"" my foot in place, and straps that work across your foot, that are not in the ball part of your foot, work out really well usually. Especially if they hold across your arch.

# The Ones I've Tried.. And Probably Won't Re-buy

Now remember, just because I tried these on and had these reactions, *doesn't mean they won't work for you*. Ever person is different, and these might be the greatest shoe for you. If so, great!! But, I want to be honest in my reactions and these were ones that weren't enough for me.

* [Tieks](https://tieks.com/cobalt.html) ($175)
   * The most expensive foot condom out there! I got cobalt, but it actually is closer to a corn flower blue. Here were my opinions.
   * Pros:
      * I *loved* the bottom teal soles. And I mean they are teal. Like, sixty-year-old-aunt-who-just-loves-going-to-brunch-in-bejeweled-sandals-and-has-these-capris-in-this-color-that-just-screams-""oh, fun!"" teal. These things are Tom Hardy hardy. Nothing can get through them. I mean, when the teenage dystopian future comes, and I need something pure and tough to protect me from my Roomba Feline overlord while having a PG-13 level romantic moment with a guy with the perfect 90s [mcdonalds logo](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-05/enhanced/webdr08/23/15/original-grid-image-28196-1400875025-6.jpg?crop=588:882;19,0&downsize=400:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto) shaped hair bangs, I'm heading straight to the Tieks warehouses. I will wear my teal plated armor with pride as [I ride into battle](https://media.giphy.com/media/6901DbEbbm4o0/giphy.gif).
      * Great returns policy!
   * Cons:
      * I got an 8, they were too way too long. So I had to return, got a 7, but I could tell it's too small as my feel spill out on the side a bit. They don't do half sizes :(.
      * The inner sole is a very smooth leather. I could complain about how it quickly [tinted from sweat](https://crazytogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tieks-24-1024x684.jpg) (link to photo I found), but I have a Much Bigger Issue to bring up. You know when you wear new shoes, and you're feeling just plain sassy. I mean just feeling your stuff as your round the cubicle corner, your executive partner of your firm will walk by, and you'll realize your shoes are squeaking out a fart noise with *every single step* as your heel moves on the leather. That's right, I had to make strong eye contact to a[ssert my corporate dominance](https://media.giphy.com/media/52FcaTVc9Y1rk7q1NQ/giphy.gif) with the patriarchy while making foot fart noises. I've owned them for 6 months... and they're still fartin'.
      * The leather that is the canvas of the shoe is a bit thicker and stronger than the usual foot condoms. While I actually like a lot of that at first, it does show that they are using better materials, I had a few issue with it I didn't expect. Mostly, that because the elastic tension was stronger, it pinched my big toe down non stop. As a result, I can only wear these for about 5 hours. After words it feels like I've put a pair of [pliers](https://media.giphy.com/media/kAhYjZZlSCLRu/giphy.gif) on my giant toe nail and took an hour to undo out of the shoes. I've shoe stretched them 3 times, and still have this problem. I found a photo that shows what I mean. See the big toe [dent](https://crazytogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tieks-22-1024x684.jpg)?
* [Rothy's Pointed Toe](https://rothys.com/products/the-point-black-solid) ($145)
   * Another internet favorite. I got a size 8. I really wanted to like these.
   * Pros:
      * These actually fit pretty well for the ball of my foot. I had a little spill on the side, but a lot less than usual. It did feel ""long"" but I expected that for the pointed toe.
      * The shoe sole was really strong here too.
      * Really soft!
      * I love, love, love the eco factor here. It was one of the main reasons I bought them.
   * Cons:
      * They shrank. It was *100% my fault*! They tout being washer friendly, however they are cold water *only*. They also cannot be put into the dryer. They absolutely shrink and cannot be stretched back out again. The reason why I put this in the con bucket, even though it was my fault, is that I live in a very, very hot part of the US. Heat is a natural part of life in Texas, so if I leave these in the car they can potentially heat up and shrink. I need shoes that can handle [90\*F](https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGppLes0ENI5osCc/giphy.gif) \+.
      * They *stank*. I have never, ever had a pair of shoes smell on me. These were the very first. Now, I know many would claim I should wash the soles, or buy new ones, but the smell was noticeable after only 3 wears. The only fix would be for me to buy a cloth sole, or similar. I'm willing to do that, but not from their soles. I don't know of any cloth pointed toe ones I would buy that would fit rothy's pointed toe specifically without causing more friction of my already tight foot. Now, could I find a ""sorta"" fit? Sure, but these are already shoes I ""sorta"" fit into. It feels like a sunk cost.
* Cheap Pointed Strappy Flats on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KTC4S4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($20)
   * I've bought a number of these types online. They usually *start* well. However, every pointed leather toe I've gotten gets dented and flakes color. And, the sole isn't very supportive.
* [Dr. Scholl's Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/dr.-scholls-leader-flat/418042?activeColor=005)
   * I cannot tell you what it is about this brand, and I have gone back lots and lots of time like a booty call, but I just cannot make it work. My problem almost every time, wide or regular width, is that the inner curve of the shoe that hits my skin will always ([always](https://media.giphy.com/media/10osILvZ4ez7ws/giphy.gif)!) pinch and leave a half moon shape of red on my skin. It seems like since they're all about comfort it would work, but it just hurts that and my toe box a lot.
   * In addition, you can see the blue interior? It's actually not that much memory foam feeling. It feels kind of hard honestly.
* [Katie and Kate Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/kelly-and-katie-pirassa-ballet-flat/398237?activeColor=840&rrec=true)
   * These have the issue of they fit really well in the store... but not after an hour when my foot swells. They fool me every time!! However, I bet narrow folks would love these really tough canvas shoes.

# Shoes I Will Buy Again:

My most bought often shoes are flats and pumps. However, I included a few others here that I liked:

* **Naturalizer** (My Gold Standard)
   * These guys are *great*. They clearly make their shoe length shorter than others, so it makes it very easy for me to buy them. I've only found one where I actually had to buy wide (their pointed toe flat). I flux between 7 and 7.5. Note I *didn't* say wide! That means it's easier for me to find in store and try on since they typically have a close enough fit.
   * Here are the ones I own:
      * [Wedge Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-hydie-wedge-pump/409290?activeColor=200) in 7.5 - (I was able to play tug on hardwood in these with my 70lb dog!)
      * [Dalee Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-dalee-pump/465864?activeColor=251)  in 7 - (I own white)
      * [Brown Wide Calf Boot](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-kelso-wide-calf-riding-boot/461558?activeColor=204) in 7 W (I have an older version)
      * [Open Strap Sandals](https://www.amazon.com/Naturalizer-Womens-Fabric-Strappy-Sandals/dp/B071XPX2YG/ref=sr_1_16?crid=1724PUKPK2Z23&keywords=naturalizer+velcro+sandals+for+women&qid=1564330866&s=gateway&sprefix=naturalizer+velcro%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-16) in 7.5 (Don't let the Velcro strap fool you, these are a god send)
* **Ann Klein** **Sport** (Favorite for Work)
   * These guys are great for anything I need for work. They usually have a lot of elastic without it being obvious. I continual go to them for my standards. Right now I own:
      * [Black Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/anne-klein-sport-oalise-flat/446556?activeColor=960) in 7
* **Sketcher's Bobs** (Slip On)
   * WE STAN MEMORY FOAM. And they donate to charities based on the designs. My favorite are the puppy ones. I own:
      * [Black Heather](https://www.amazon.com/Skechers-Womens-Plush-33910-Black-Heather/dp/B00PRA6TSA/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=sketchers+bobs&qid=1564331066&s=gateway&sr=8-2) in 7.5
* **Addias Cloud Foam Sneakers** (Fashion Sneaker)
   * Run, don't walk, to [these](https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Womens-Cloudfoam-Advantage-Sneakers/dp/B01HSIRMSE/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=adidas+women+sneakers&qid=1564282094&s=gateway&sr=8-9). These are the best. Got them at nordstrom rack for a steal. I've worn them overseas and back, and they're [GREAT](https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IvnJQAy7SGlcR2/giphy.gif).
* **Lucky Brand Ellie Flat** (Budget Buy)
   * This is borderline tiek-like, but It isn't too much that it creates that ""C"" when not worn. It doesn't have the thickest bottom, but they fit really well for what price point they come at. And the leather is really easy to stretch with a shoe stretcher.
      * [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Brand-Womens-American-Leather/dp/B00HRVXKWU/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ellie+flat&qid=1564317512&s=gateway&sr=8-2) in 7.5
* **Booties & Boots**
   * I love talking about these because my husband gets mad and thinks I mean the baby shoes (lol). No, but seriously shoes that are boots are basically a god send for wide shoe people. They're basically sneaker fits but with more professional fit. Here are ones I like:
      * [Riverberry](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010QWX1ZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (These are lasting! Great for the price)
      * [MVE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GJYYLYY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (These have a real hearty heel, almost like a cowboy boot)
      * Target has a few great ones too
* **ModCloth T Strap Flat**
   * These have a *great* wide width, but I still had the 'pointed toe dent' issue. However, in all other ways these excel. I got a blue set with flowers on it that are a compliment magnet.
   * [Link](https://www.modcloth.com/shop/shoes/modcloth-turn-back-prime-t-strap-flat-in-navy-floral/165008.html) in 7W
* **A\*\*\*\*rbella**
   * I got some at DSW, and they're definitely the ""wear all day at work"" pair of heels. Super comfortable, but is a kitten heel. They aren't sexy, but they work! There is also a clear knit/stretch to the fabric so it's great for me. Overall though, their inner sole is really great to stand on, and they have a few other fun colors. I got away with not going W for my size
   * [Judith Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/abella-judith-pump/349651?activeColor=001)
* [Clarks](https://www.amazon.com/CLARKS-Womens-Adriel-Viola-Leather/dp/B01N5CWLR4/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=clarks&qid=1564281229&s=gateway&sr=8-15) & [Life Stride](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/2595472011?_encoding=UTF8&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=LifeStride&ref_=w_bl_sl_ap_sh_web_2595472011)
   * I have a few heels from both of them , and they're great for the standard day to day. I'm not excited personally on their other styles, but if you need a nude heel that works, these get the job done. I found life stride though does tend to pinch after a while on the area near the arch to the top of the shoe. But I suspect I need to size up or stretch more.
   * I own:
      * [LifeStride Seemless Dress Pump (7.5W)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0117ZX5C6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Me Too](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/me-too-pacific-loafer/459726?activeColor=543)
   * These definitely can have the corporate grandma feel if you let them, but every now and then they pop out some really nice stuff. Great support inside the heel.
* [COM & SENS](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-pomaro-pump/400535?activeColor=061) (And [another](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-brunna-sandal/429890?activeColor=002), and [another](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-missy-wedge-sandal/450318?activeColor=200)) is my new up and comer
   * They tend to have a lot of ""elastic"" elements that aren't the shoe itself. It's really great for the stretch without the shoe spill over issue. Now, their look isn't for all, as it's typically obvious it's a comfort shoe, but who cares? Do what you [wanttttt](https://media.giphy.com/media/jL0c2TrfDUz9S/giphy.gif). They also always have great arch support.

# The Shoes I'm Eyeing But Haven't Bought

* More Naturalizer (*ALWAYS*)
   * I want a blush pink flat or similar, so I'm eyeing their site.
* [CINAK Flats](https://www.amazon.com/CINAK-Women-Flats-Shoes-Slip/dp/B07DZZ7G7G/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=comfort+flats&qid=1564282006&s=gateway&sr=8-10) (Budget Pick)
* [Antonia Saint](https://www.antoniasaintny.com/)
   * Their ads are all about how it's a heel that feels like a sneaker. Very curious
* [AllBirds](https://www.allbirds.com/)
* [Arbella Quanta Flat](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/abella-quanta-flat/457185?activeColor=001)

Last Updated: 10/27/2019

&#x200B;

Got some recs? Please share and I'll post them here!",1564402480.0,"My Wide Foot Manifesto (With Recs!) I'm posting this on a few commented suggestions from my previous post on Rothy's Dupes.

&#x200B;

I'm a 5 foot 4 inches woman, 140 lbs, with a larger bust. I'm also, not ""ideally shaped"". Meaning I am familiar with the constant search for the ""short"" length, the slim ""petite"" selections, and the white whale ""wide width"" shoe. As a result, I am *constantly* shopping for clothes that actually fit. Yes, it's fun, but finding something that truly fits has been an uphill battle since day zero (I'm a programmer, [we start arrays at zero](https://xkcd.com/163/)!). So, me and my pizza shaped feet have been On. A. Mission. To find the ideal wide shoe. (*Spoiler*: The ideal shoe [were the friends we found along the way](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72F0Bvsi8CLuY5KE/giphy.gif)).

Okay, here are the things to know:

# The Bad Wide Shoe Traits

Here are things I've experienced with wide shoes that, well, suck. Some of these also apply to our Narrow sisters as well!

1. **Fewer Options (color/styles)**
   1. Wide shoes aren't typically made in all the colors and models for each shoe. Simply because we're not the ""key demographic"" according to the makers, and try to cover us while making a decent overhead. It is annoying because I cannot buy a pair of red shoes without significant effort. A person who isn't can't do that.
   2. [Exhibit A](https://imgur.com/vnasrmE): ""Pumps Women"" unfiltered search on DSW
      1. This is a set of sexy stilettos. The SEO here is like, ""oh yeah, firey hot red sexy lady party, rock on. Go out on the town, go the clubs. Party. Meet a sexy person, be sexy, take a sexy selfie, oh, ah, oh ah, only at mattress giant. This is great, want it in red? GET IT IN RED YOU SEXY PERSON YOU. YES. FIERCE, [BLUE STEEL](https://media.giphy.com/media/X9RBixlR36Uco/giphy.gif), VOGUE, GO GO YES, INTO THE CAMERA, MAKE LOVE TO THE CAMERA.""
   3. [Exhibit B](https://imgur.com/tklIq6N): Filtered to Wide
      1. This set of shoes is reserved for the shaded area of a Venn diagram consisting of matronly knitting, and [community](https://media.giphy.com/media/gQsfOW387X9Hq/giphy.gif) college business course photos with just the right amount of diverse representation.
2. **Settling for Floppy/Hurtful Shoes**
   1. The shoes I've gotten ""close enough"" to fitting, flop a lot on the end of it. What happens is I buy a shoe that fits at the ball of my foot, so it ""stays"". However, when I step up, the back of the heel flops. However, I am at a corporate job so I *need* a pair of black heels, and I have a meeting on Monday morning. So you end up buying the pair of shoes, and basically powering through until they're ""broken in"" or you throw them out. This is doubly terrible for heels because you will fall on your bum!
3. **They're Expensive**
   1. Typically they're not only tougher to find, but more expensive. As with any specialty sizing, like petite sizing, they cost more. The brands serve a smaller market, and so they try to either make their money back (or understand we're willing to pay) by asking for more. In addition, if there is a shoe you *really* love, you try to make it work by stretching or adding pads. This also are more costs and time for one pair of shoes.
   2. Note: I, for one am VERY WILLING to shell out cash for great shoes that fit. I just.. haven't found any!
4. **They're Only Online**
   1. Like any specialty sizing, they're typically more options only online. That means it's a gamble when you order if it *actually* fits. You usually have to order two, only to find both don't work (figures!). Then you have to do the return dance which sucks.
5. **Foot Condoms**
   1. Okay, this is a major pet peeve for me. Most, if not all women, own what I refer to as a ""foot condom"". These are those weirdo [scrunchy shoes](https://www.amazon.com/Ollio-Womens-Shoes-Comfort-Ballet/dp/B07978X8NM/ref=cts_sh_3_vtp) that leaves nothing to the imagination, and arch up when not worn.
      1. What are they? They are little tiny wisps of fabric that are glued to your foot like a trash bag was vacuumed around your big ass toes. Nothing is left to the imagination. No your toe cleavage may not be showing, but the other feet sure as hell knows when your feet are in a cold space or feelin' frisky (watch out for foot matching dances). They also have the shoe thickness of those slices of tomato they show on the home shopping network where they're selling high quality Japanese knives for 80 easy payments of 4 cents and need to read the newspaper through a fruit. You have no protections against mini potholes, Arctic conference rooms, or [upcoming corporate singularity with these shoes](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IylOPCNkiqOgMyA/giphy.gif). However, they *are* perfect for your upcoming costume part in Bath for Jane Austen day, and look! They have a cute little bow that will annoy and bounce. How [quaint](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JdZUPzYZ3cL1fFK/giphy.gif)!
      2. I hate them, BUT I end up owning 14 pairs. Why? They are the best fit for the weirdest feet. As a result, even though I think they're kind of ugly and don't work, and *I need some goddess damn black flats for* [work](https://media.giphy.com/media/w3RhszxPfflAs/giphy.gif) you settle for them.
6. **Harder to ""tailor"" shoes**
   1. While in some cases it may work, it is much harder to tailor a shoe versus a piece of clothing. As a [short](https://reductress.com/post/man-love-tiny-woman-because-she-make-feel-big/) person, I can tailor my skirts or my shirts. But, getting my shoes widened, and shortened is much harder to get done. I usually have to find a shoe hospital, or similar. It's easier to find a local dry cleaner that tailors than a shoe place.

# Know your official size, and if you're wide

The easiest way is to get out a ruler and put your foot on it (many prefer to draw around your foot on a paper on the ground then compare that). Then go to [this site](http://www.sizecharter.com/clothing-fit-and-measurement/understanding-shoe-sizing) and check your length, and your width. I am the length of a US 7, and the width of a 7.5 W. So I'm too short and wide. Considering my [hot slice of a pizza](https://media.giphy.com/media/6EncNPTYts8lq/giphy.gif) body, this matches. However, most of my shoes are closer to 7 or 7.5 as I often find it's easier to stretch a shoe then shorten it.

# What ""other things"" can I do to make my shoes fit better?

There are a few things to expand your options. Sadly, all of them require you to spend more cash. But, here ya go:

* **Get a** [**Shoe Stretcher**](https://www.amazon.com/Eachway-Professional-Premium-Stretcher-Adjustable/dp/B01NAKQEBL/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=shoe+stretcher&qid=1564278621&s=gateway&sr=8-3)
   * I stretch all my shoes for 24 hr (per shoe) before I buy. As I have a more short than wide foot, I end up buying a size down and trying to stretch it.
* **Buy Ankle** [**Pads**](https://www.amazon.com/Heel-Cushion-Inserts-Prevention-Protectors/dp/B07GXHT6GR/ref=sr_1_23?keywords=shoe+pads&qid=1564278732&s=gateway&sr=8-23)
   * If you buy a shoe that fits your width, but *not* your ankle, you usually get a lot of ""flops"". You can add pads that sit inside the ankle. However these I typically have issues with. I end up having a large gap between where my ankle top hits the pad, and the bottom half doesn't. That leaves room for slipping around if I go in funny angles (which is... [often](https://media.giphy.com/media/TfKfqjt2i4GIM/giphy.gif).)
* **Get your shoe adjusted**
   * You'd have to find a place in town that does this. It's very hit or miss per city, and typically costs over $50. I wouldn't recommend this for the average shoe. I did find an [online place](https://www.myshoehospital.com/), but I haven't tried it.

Frankly... these are about it. If your shoe doesn't fit, it's either this o[r live with it.](https://media.giphy.com/media/oFI7FttD0iC8V2Iqmy/giphy.gif)

# Shoe Features to Avoid In Standard Sizing

&#x200B;

* **Strict mid ball straps** ([Example](https://www.amazon.com/MVE-Shoes-Womens-Single-Joana-1/dp/B07V3NMK58/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=strap+heels&qid=1564280919&s=gateway&sr=8-5))
   * This is very hit or miss. If there is a strap right across the ball of the foot, it might be the perfect width if you size up, but that only works if you got a *very* adjustable ankle strap. If you do, it works out nicely since you just size up and adjust that. If you don't, then you end up just rubbing up against it like a [dog in heat](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/190/cover.jpg).
* **Peep Toe**
   * Usually I never have the right foot to length ratio to make my foot cleavage make all the foot boys come to my foot yard.
* **Mules**
   * These are shoes that are ""covered"" in the front half but not the back. They just never really work. What ends up happening is a flip flop, but it hits your heel with the intensity of more cowbell. It isn't worth the loud [slapping](https://media.giphy.com/media/1zgOyLCRxCmV5G3GFZ/giphy.gif).
* **Canvases with no stretch**
   * Sometimes this is fine, but if you're wide you typically search for the stretchiest shoe material (See my foot condom rant) for a reason. The downside of it stretching to fit you is that the foot will spill over the sides or front, leaving it unprotected from the ground. This can lead to back issues. See Naomi Small's [season 8 entrance look](https://external-preview.redd.it/7bgA1Bn27pwwWiRU6L6XwSQ94O210ZwFH7BV61W-70o.jpg?width=1200&height=628.272251309&auto=webp&s=7a54909628fe451100056e1ca699eb61e01f64ac).

&#x200B;

# Signs a Shoe May Work Out!

* **A very adjustable ankle strap, or elastic back.** Lets you have a wide front but will fit your ""narrower"" to width ratio ankle
   * [Example](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-day-heel-brightred?collection=womens-heels)
* **Stretcher Canvas.** Like I said before, this does lead to a spill over, but this might work if the shoe sole bottom is wide enough. This is why knit flats are so popular.
   * [Example](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/skechers-cleo-flat/420522?activeColor=017&rrec=true)
* **If it... comes is a wide size!**! Okay, this one is a given
* **Not a stiff pointed toe.** This one sucks to write because I'm basically saying that a certain style won't be in your wheel house, and I love this type. However, what happens is the pointed toe goes from wide to point too quickly, and you end up either a) having a real awkward bulge in your shoe, that you may need to cover with a [binder in middle school](https://media.giphy.com/media/14dXclYKbx2ONW/giphy.gif), or b) it pinches and hurts.
* **Lots of Non Ankle Straps.** My favorite shoes tend to be ones that ""hold"" my foot in place, and straps that work across your foot, that are not in the ball part of your foot, work out really well usually. Especially if they hold across your arch.

# The Ones I've Tried.. And Probably Won't Re-buy

Now remember, just because I tried these on and had these reactions, *doesn't mean they won't work for you*. Ever person is different, and these might be the greatest shoe for you. If so, great!! But, I want to be honest in my reactions and these were ones that weren't enough for me.

* [Tieks](https://tieks.com/cobalt.html) ($175)
   * The most expensive foot condom out there! I got cobalt, but it actually is closer to a corn flower blue. Here were my opinions.
   * Pros:
      * I *loved* the bottom teal soles. And I mean they are teal. Like, sixty-year-old-aunt-who-just-loves-going-to-brunch-in-bejeweled-sandals-and-has-these-capris-in-this-color-that-just-screams-""oh, fun!"" teal. These things are Tom Hardy hardy. Nothing can get through them. I mean, when the teenage dystopian future comes, and I need something pure and tough to protect me from my Roomba Feline overlord while having a PG-13 level romantic moment with a guy with the perfect 90s [mcdonalds logo](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-05/enhanced/webdr08/23/15/original-grid-image-28196-1400875025-6.jpg?crop=588:882;19,0&downsize=400:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto) shaped hair bangs, I'm heading straight to the Tieks warehouses. I will wear my teal plated armor with pride as [I ride into battle](https://media.giphy.com/media/6901DbEbbm4o0/giphy.gif).
      * Great returns policy!
   * Cons:
      * I got an 8, they were too way too long. So I had to return, got a 7, but I could tell it's too small as my feel spill out on the side a bit. They don't do half sizes :(.
      * The inner sole is a very smooth leather. I could complain about how it quickly [tinted from sweat](https://crazytogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tieks-24-1024x684.jpg) (link to photo I found), but I have a Much Bigger Issue to bring up. You know when you wear new shoes, and you're feeling just plain sassy. I mean just feeling your stuff as your round the cubicle corner, your executive partner of your firm will walk by, and you'll realize your shoes are squeaking out a fart noise with *every single step* as your heel moves on the leather. That's right, I had to make strong eye contact to a[ssert my corporate dominance](https://media.giphy.com/media/52FcaTVc9Y1rk7q1NQ/giphy.gif) with the patriarchy while making foot fart noises. I've owned them for 6 months... and they're still fartin'.
      * The leather that is the canvas of the shoe is a bit thicker and stronger than the usual foot condoms. While I actually like a lot of that at first, it does show that they are using better materials, I had a few issue with it I didn't expect. Mostly, that because the elastic tension was stronger, it pinched my big toe down non stop. As a result, I can only wear these for about 5 hours. After words it feels like I've put a pair of [pliers](https://media.giphy.com/media/kAhYjZZlSCLRu/giphy.gif) on my giant toe nail and took an hour to undo out of the shoes. I've shoe stretched them 3 times, and still have this problem. I found a photo that shows what I mean. See the big toe [dent](https://crazytogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tieks-22-1024x684.jpg)?
* [Rothy's Pointed Toe](https://rothys.com/products/the-point-black-solid) ($145)
   * Another internet favorite. I got a size 8. I really wanted to like these.
   * Pros:
      * These actually fit pretty well for the ball of my foot. I had a little spill on the side, but a lot less than usual. It did feel ""long"" but I expected that for the pointed toe.
      * The shoe sole was really strong here too.
      * Really soft!
      * I love, love, love the eco factor here. It was one of the main reasons I bought them.
   * Cons:
      * They shrank. It was *100% my fault*! They tout being washer friendly, however they are cold water *only*. They also cannot be put into the dryer. They absolutely shrink and cannot be stretched back out again. The reason why I put this in the con bucket, even though it was my fault, is that I live in a very, very hot part of the US. Heat is a natural part of life in Texas, so if I leave these in the car they can potentially heat up and shrink. I need shoes that can handle [90\*F](https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGppLes0ENI5osCc/giphy.gif) \+.
      * They *stank*. I have never, ever had a pair of shoes smell on me. These were the very first. Now, I know many would claim I should wash the soles, or buy new ones, but the smell was noticeable after only 3 wears. The only fix would be for me to buy a cloth sole, or similar. I'm willing to do that, but not from their soles. I don't know of any cloth pointed toe ones I would buy that would fit rothy's pointed toe specifically without causing more friction of my already tight foot. Now, could I find a ""sorta"" fit? Sure, but these are already shoes I ""sorta"" fit into. It feels like a sunk cost.
* Cheap Pointed Strappy Flats on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KTC4S4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($20)
   * I've bought a number of these types online. They usually *start* well. However, every pointed leather toe I've gotten gets dented and flakes color. And, the sole isn't very supportive.
* [Dr. Scholl's Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/dr.-scholls-leader-flat/418042?activeColor=005)
   * I cannot tell you what it is about this brand, and I have gone back lots and lots of time like a booty call, but I just cannot make it work. My problem almost every time, wide or regular width, is that the inner curve of the shoe that hits my skin will always ([always](https://media.giphy.com/media/10osILvZ4ez7ws/giphy.gif)!) pinch and leave a half moon shape of red on my skin. It seems like since they're all about comfort it would work, but it just hurts that and my toe box a lot.
   * In addition, you can see the blue interior? It's actually not that much memory foam feeling. It feels kind of hard honestly.
* [Katie and Kate Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/kelly-and-katie-pirassa-ballet-flat/398237?activeColor=840&rrec=true)
   * These have the issue of they fit really well in the store... but not after an hour when my foot swells. They fool me every time!! However, I bet narrow folks would love these really tough canvas shoes.

# Shoes I Will Buy Again:

My most bought often shoes are flats and pumps. However, I included a few others here that I liked:

* **Naturalizer** (My Gold Standard)
   * These guys are *great*. They clearly make their shoe length shorter than others, so it makes it very easy for me to buy them. I've only found one where I actually had to buy wide (their pointed toe flat). I flux between 7 and 7.5. Note I *didn't* say wide! That means it's easier for me to find in store and try on since they typically have a close enough fit.
   * Here are the ones I own:
      * [Wedge Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-hydie-wedge-pump/409290?activeColor=200) in 7.5 - (I was able to play tug on hardwood in these with my 70lb dog!)
      * [Dalee Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-dalee-pump/465864?activeColor=251)  in 7 - (I own white)
      * [Brown Wide Calf Boot](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-kelso-wide-calf-riding-boot/461558?activeColor=204) in 7 W (I have an older version)
      * [Open Strap Sandals](https://www.amazon.com/Naturalizer-Womens-Fabric-Strappy-Sandals/dp/B071XPX2YG/ref=sr_1_16?crid=1724PUKPK2Z23&keywords=naturalizer+velcro+sandals+for+women&qid=1564330866&s=gateway&sprefix=naturalizer+velcro%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-16) in 7.5 (Don't let the Velcro strap fool you, these are a god send)
* **Ann Klein** **Sport** (Favorite for Work)
   * These guys are great for anything I need for work. They usually have a lot of elastic without it being obvious. I continual go to them for my standards. Right now I own:
      * [Black Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/anne-klein-sport-oalise-flat/446556?activeColor=960) in 7
* **Sketcher's Bobs** (Slip On)
   * WE STAN MEMORY FOAM. And they donate to charities based on the designs. My favorite are the puppy ones. I own:
      * [Black Heather](https://www.amazon.com/Skechers-Womens-Plush-33910-Black-Heather/dp/B00PRA6TSA/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=sketchers+bobs&qid=1564331066&s=gateway&sr=8-2) in 7.5
* **Addias Cloud Foam Sneakers** (Fashion Sneaker)
   * Run, don't walk, to [these](https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Womens-Cloudfoam-Advantage-Sneakers/dp/B01HSIRMSE/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=adidas+women+sneakers&qid=1564282094&s=gateway&sr=8-9). These are the best. Got them at nordstrom rack for a steal. I've worn them overseas and back, and they're [GREAT](https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IvnJQAy7SGlcR2/giphy.gif).
* **Lucky Brand Ellie Flat** (Budget Buy)
   * This is borderline tiek-like, but It isn't too much that it creates that ""C"" when not worn. It doesn't have the thickest bottom, but they fit really well for what price point they come at. And the leather is really easy to stretch with a shoe stretcher.
      * [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Brand-Womens-American-Leather/dp/B00HRVXKWU/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ellie+flat&qid=1564317512&s=gateway&sr=8-2) in 7.5
* **Booties & Boots**
   * I love talking about these because my husband gets mad and thinks I mean the baby shoes (lol). No, but seriously shoes that are boots are basically a god send for wide shoe people. They're basically sneaker fits but with more professional fit. Here are ones I like:
      * [Riverberry](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010QWX1ZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (These are lasting! Great for the price)
      * [MVE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GJYYLYY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (These have a real hearty heel, almost like a cowboy boot)
      * Target has a few great ones too
* **ModCloth T Strap Flat**
   * These have a *great* wide width, but I still had the 'pointed toe dent' issue. However, in all other ways these excel. I got a blue set with flowers on it that are a compliment magnet.
   * [Link](https://www.modcloth.com/shop/shoes/modcloth-turn-back-prime-t-strap-flat-in-navy-floral/165008.html) in 7W
* **A\*\*\*\*rbella**
   * I got some at DSW, and they're definitely the ""wear all day at work"" pair of heels. Super comfortable, but is a kitten heel. They aren't sexy, but they work! There is also a clear knit/stretch to the fabric so it's great for me. Overall though, their inner sole is really great to stand on, and they have a few other fun colors. I got away with not going W for my size
   * [Judith Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/abella-judith-pump/349651?activeColor=001)
* [Clarks](https://www.amazon.com/CLARKS-Womens-Adriel-Viola-Leather/dp/B01N5CWLR4/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=clarks&qid=1564281229&s=gateway&sr=8-15) & [Life Stride](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/2595472011?_encoding=UTF8&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=LifeStride&ref_=w_bl_sl_ap_sh_web_2595472011)
   * I have a few heels from both of them , and they're great for the standard day to day. I'm not excited personally on their other styles, but if you need a nude heel that works, these get the job done. I found life stride though does tend to pinch after a while on the area near the arch to the top of the shoe. But I suspect I need to size up or stretch more.
   * I own:
      * [LifeStride Seemless Dress Pump (7.5W)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0117ZX5C6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Me Too](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/me-too-pacific-loafer/459726?activeColor=543)
   * These definitely can have the corporate grandma feel if you let them, but every now and then they pop out some really nice stuff. Great support inside the heel.
* [COM & SENS](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-pomaro-pump/400535?activeColor=061) (And [another](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-brunna-sandal/429890?activeColor=002), and [another](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-missy-wedge-sandal/450318?activeColor=200)) is my new up and comer
   * They tend to have a lot of ""elastic"" elements that aren't the shoe itself. It's really great for the stretch without the shoe spill over issue. Now, their look isn't for all, as it's typically obvious it's a comfort shoe, but who cares? Do what you [wanttttt](https://media.giphy.com/media/jL0c2TrfDUz9S/giphy.gif). They also always have great arch support.

# The Shoes I'm Eyeing But Haven't Bought

* More Naturalizer (*ALWAYS*)
   * I want a blush pink flat or similar, so I'm eyeing their site.
* [CINAK Flats](https://www.amazon.com/CINAK-Women-Flats-Shoes-Slip/dp/B07DZZ7G7G/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=comfort+flats&qid=1564282006&s=gateway&sr=8-10) (Budget Pick)
* [Antonia Saint](https://www.antoniasaintny.com/)
   * Their ads are all about how it's a heel that feels like a sneaker. Very curious
* [AllBirds](https://www.allbirds.com/)
* [Arbella Quanta Flat](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/abella-quanta-flat/457185?activeColor=001)

Last Updated: 10/27/2019

&#x200B;

Got some recs? Please share and I'll post them here!","my wide foot manifesto with recs im posting this on a few commented suggestions from my previous post on rothys dupes

x200b

im a 5 foot 4 inches woman 140 lbs with a larger bust im also not ideally shaped meaning i am familiar with the constant search for the short length the slim petite selections and the white whale wide width shoe as a result i am constantly shopping for clothes that actually fit yes its fun but finding something that truly fits has been an uphill battle since day zero im a programmer we start arrays at zero so me and my pizza shaped feet have been on a mission to find the ideal wide shoe spoiler the ideal shoe were the friends we found along the way

okay here are the things to know

 the bad wide shoe traits

here are things ive experienced with wide shoes that well suck some of these also apply to our narrow sisters as well

1 fewer options colorstyles
   1 wide shoes arent typically made in all the colors and models for each shoe simply because were not the key demographic according to the makers and try to cover us while making a decent overhead it is annoying because i cannot buy a pair of red shoes without significant effort a person who isnt cant do that
   2 exhibit a pumps women unfiltered search on dsw
      1 this is a set of sexy stilettos the seo here is like oh yeah firey hot red sexy lady party rock on go out on the town go the clubs party meet a sexy person be sexy take a sexy selfie oh ah oh ah only at mattress giant this is great want it in red get it in red you sexy person you yes fierce blue steel vogue go go yes into the camera make love to the camera
   3 exhibit b filtered to wide
      1 this set of shoes is reserved for the shaded area of a venn diagram consisting of matronly knitting and community college business course photos with just the right amount of diverse representation
2 settling for floppyhurtful shoes
   1 the shoes ive gotten close enough to fitting flop a lot on the end of it what happens is i buy a shoe that fits at the ball of my foot so it stays however when i step up the back of the heel flops however i am at a corporate job so i need a pair of black heels and i have a meeting on monday morning so you end up buying the pair of shoes and basically powering through until theyre broken in or you throw them out this is doubly terrible for heels because you will fall on your bum
3 theyre expensive
   1 typically theyre not only tougher to find but more expensive as with any specialty sizing like petite sizing they cost more the brands serve a smaller market and so they try to either make their money back or understand were willing to pay by asking for more in addition if there is a shoe you really love you try to make it work by stretching or adding pads this also are more costs and time for one pair of shoes
   2 note i for one am very willing to shell out cash for great shoes that fit i just havent found any
4 theyre only online
   1 like any specialty sizing theyre typically more options only online that means its a gamble when you order if it actually fits you usually have to order two only to find both dont work figures then you have to do the return dance which sucks
5 foot condoms
   1 okay this is a major pet peeve for me most if not all women own what i refer to as a foot condom these are those weirdo scrunchy shoes that leaves nothing to the imagination and arch up when not worn
      1 what are they they are little tiny wisps of fabric that are glued to your foot like a trash bag was vacuumed around your big ass toes nothing is left to the imagination no your toe cleavage may not be showing but the other feet sure as hell knows when your feet are in a cold space or feelin frisky watch out for foot matching dances they also have the shoe thickness of those slices of tomato they show on the home shopping network where theyre selling high quality japanese knives for 80 easy payments of 4 cents and need to read the newspaper through a fruit you have no protections against mini potholes arctic conference rooms or upcoming corporate singularity with these shoes however they are perfect for your upcoming costume part in bath for jane austen day and look they have a cute little bow that will annoy and bounce how quaint
      2 i hate them but i end up owning 14 pairs why they are the best fit for the weirdest feet as a result even though i think theyre kind of ugly and dont work and i need some goddess damn black flats for work you settle for them
6 harder to tailor shoes
   1 while in some cases it may work it is much harder to tailor a shoe versus a piece of clothing as a short person i can tailor my skirts or my shirts but getting my shoes widened and shortened is much harder to get done i usually have to find a shoe hospital or similar its easier to find a local dry cleaner that tailors than a shoe place

 know your official size and if youre wide

the easiest way is to get out a ruler and put your foot on it many prefer to draw around your foot on a paper on the ground then compare that then go to this site and check your length and your width i am the length of a us 7 and the width of a 75 w so im too short and wide considering my hot slice of a pizza body this matches however most of my shoes are closer to 7 or 75 as i often find its easier to stretch a shoe then shorten it

 what other things can i do to make my shoes fit better

there are a few things to expand your options sadly all of them require you to spend more cash but here ya go

 get a shoe stretcher
    i stretch all my shoes for 24 hr per shoe before i buy as i have a more short than wide foot i end up buying a size down and trying to stretch it
 buy ankle pads
    if you buy a shoe that fits your width but not your ankle you usually get a lot of flops you can add pads that sit inside the ankle however these i typically have issues with i end up having a large gap between where my ankle top hits the pad and the bottom half doesnt that leaves room for slipping around if i go in funny angles which is often
 get your shoe adjusted
    youd have to find a place in town that does this its very hit or miss per city and typically costs over 50 i wouldnt recommend this for the average shoe i did find an online place but i havent tried it

frankly these are about it if your shoe doesnt fit its either this or live with it

 shoe features to avoid in standard sizing

x200b

 strict mid ball straps example
    this is very hit or miss if there is a strap right across the ball of the foot it might be the perfect width if you size up but that only works if you got a very adjustable ankle strap if you do it works out nicely since you just size up and adjust that if you dont then you end up just rubbing up against it like a dog in heat
 peep toe
    usually i never have the right foot to length ratio to make my foot cleavage make all the foot boys come to my foot yard
 mules
    these are shoes that are covered in the front half but not the back they just never really work what ends up happening is a flip flop but it hits your heel with the intensity of more cowbell it isnt worth the loud slapping
 canvases with no stretch
    sometimes this is fine but if youre wide you typically search for the stretchiest shoe material see my foot condom rant for a reason the downside of it stretching to fit you is that the foot will spill over the sides or front leaving it unprotected from the ground this can lead to back issues see naomi smalls season 8 entrance look

x200b

 signs a shoe may work out

 a very adjustable ankle strap or elastic back lets you have a wide front but will fit your narrower to width ratio ankle
    example
 stretcher canvas like i said before this does lead to a spill over but this might work if the shoe sole bottom is wide enough this is why knit flats are so popular
    example
 if it comes is a wide size okay this one is a given
 not a stiff pointed toe this one sucks to write because im basically saying that a certain style wont be in your wheel house and i love this type however what happens is the pointed toe goes from wide to point too quickly and you end up either a having a real awkward bulge in your shoe that you may need to cover with a binder in middle school or b it pinches and hurts
 lots of non ankle straps my favorite shoes tend to be ones that hold my foot in place and straps that work across your foot that are not in the ball part of your foot work out really well usually especially if they hold across your arch

 the ones ive tried and probably wont rebuy

now remember just because i tried these on and had these reactions doesnt mean they wont work for you ever person is different and these might be the greatest shoe for you if so great but i want to be honest in my reactions and these were ones that werent enough for me

 tieks 175
    the most expensive foot condom out there i got cobalt but it actually is closer to a corn flower blue here were my opinions
    pros
       i loved the bottom teal soles and i mean they are teal like sixtyyearoldauntwhojustlovesgoingtobrunchinbejeweledsandalsandhasthesecaprisinthiscolorthatjustscreamsoh fun teal these things are tom hardy hardy nothing can get through them i mean when the teenage dystopian future comes and i need something pure and tough to protect me from my roomba feline overlord while having a pg13 level romantic moment with a guy with the perfect 90s mcdonalds logo shaped hair bangs im heading straight to the tieks warehouses i will wear my teal plated armor with pride as i ride into battle
       great returns policy
    cons
       i got an 8 they were too way too long so i had to return got a 7 but i could tell its too small as my feel spill out on the side a bit they dont do half sizes 
       the inner sole is a very smooth leather i could complain about how it quickly tinted from sweat link to photo i found but i have a much bigger issue to bring up you know when you wear new shoes and youre feeling just plain sassy i mean just feeling your stuff as your round the cubicle corner your executive partner of your firm will walk by and youll realize your shoes are squeaking out a fart noise with every single step as your heel moves on the leather thats right i had to make strong eye contact to assert my corporate dominance with the patriarchy while making foot fart noises ive owned them for 6 months and theyre still fartin
       the leather that is the canvas of the shoe is a bit thicker and stronger than the usual foot condoms while i actually like a lot of that at first it does show that they are using better materials i had a few issue with it i didnt expect mostly that because the elastic tension was stronger it pinched my big toe down non stop as a result i can only wear these for about 5 hours after words it feels like ive put a pair of pliers on my giant toe nail and took an hour to undo out of the shoes ive shoe stretched them 3 times and still have this problem i found a photo that shows what i mean see the big toe dent
 rothys pointed toe 145
    another internet favorite i got a size 8 i really wanted to like these
    pros
       these actually fit pretty well for the ball of my foot i had a little spill on the side but a lot less than usual it did feel long but i expected that for the pointed toe
       the shoe sole was really strong here too
       really soft
       i love love love the eco factor here it was one of the main reasons i bought them
    cons
       they shrank it was 100 my fault they tout being washer friendly however they are cold water only they also cannot be put into the dryer they absolutely shrink and cannot be stretched back out again the reason why i put this in the con bucket even though it was my fault is that i live in a very very hot part of the us heat is a natural part of life in texas so if i leave these in the car they can potentially heat up and shrink i need shoes that can handle 90f 
       they stank i have never ever had a pair of shoes smell on me these were the very first now i know many would claim i should wash the soles or buy new ones but the smell was noticeable after only 3 wears the only fix would be for me to buy a cloth sole or similar im willing to do that but not from their soles i dont know of any cloth pointed toe ones i would buy that would fit rothys pointed toe specifically without causing more friction of my already tight foot now could i find a sorta fit sure but these are already shoes i sorta fit into it feels like a sunk cost
 cheap pointed strappy flats on amazon 20
    ive bought a number of these types online they usually start well however every pointed leather toe ive gotten gets dented and flakes color and the sole isnt very supportive
 dr scholls flats
    i cannot tell you what it is about this brand and i have gone back lots and lots of time like a booty call but i just cannot make it work my problem almost every time wide or regular width is that the inner curve of the shoe that hits my skin will always always pinch and leave a half moon shape of red on my skin it seems like since theyre all about comfort it would work but it just hurts that and my toe box a lot
    in addition you can see the blue interior its actually not that much memory foam feeling it feels kind of hard honestly
 katie and kate flats
    these have the issue of they fit really well in the store but not after an hour when my foot swells they fool me every time however i bet narrow folks would love these really tough canvas shoes

 shoes i will buy again

my most bought often shoes are flats and pumps however i included a few others here that i liked

 naturalizer my gold standard
    these guys are great they clearly make their shoe length shorter than others so it makes it very easy for me to buy them ive only found one where i actually had to buy wide their pointed toe flat i flux between 7 and 75 note i didnt say wide that means its easier for me to find in store and try on since they typically have a close enough fit
    here are the ones i own

 addias cloud foam sneakers fashion sneaker
    run dont walk to these these are the best got them at nordstrom rack for a steal ive worn them overseas and back and theyre great
 lucky brand ellie flat budget buy
    this is borderline tieklike but it isnt too much that it creates that c when not worn it doesnt have the thickest bottom but they fit really well for what price point they come at and the leather is really easy to stretch with a shoe stretcher
       link in 75
 booties  boots
    i love talking about these because my husband gets mad and thinks i mean the baby shoes lol no but seriously shoes that are boots are basically a god send for wide shoe people theyre basically sneaker fits but with more professional fit here are ones i like
       riverberry these are lasting great for the price
       mve these have a real hearty heel almost like a cowboy boot
       target has a few great ones too
 modcloth t strap flat
    these have a great wide width but i still had the pointed toe dent issue however in all other ways these excel i got a blue set with flowers on it that are a compliment magnet
    link in 7w
 arbella
    i got some at dsw and theyre definitely the wear all day at work pair of heels super comfortable but is a kitten heel they arent sexy but they work there is also a clear knitstretch to the fabric so its great for me overall though their inner sole is really great to stand on and they have a few other fun colors i got away with not going w for my size
    judith pump
 clarks  life stride
    i have a few heels from both of them  and theyre great for the standard day to day im not excited personally on their other styles but if you need a nude heel that works these get the job done i found life stride though does tend to pinch after a while on the area near the arch to the top of the shoe but i suspect i need to size up or stretch more
    i own
       lifestride seemless dress pump 75w
 me too
    these definitely can have the corporate grandma feel if you let them but every now and then they pop out some really nice stuff great support inside the heel
 com  sens and another and another is my new up and comer
    they tend to have a lot of elastic elements that arent the shoe itself its really great for the stretch without the shoe spill over issue now their look isnt for all as its typically obvious its a comfort shoe but who cares do what you wanttttt they also always have great arch support

I've been looking  for a bag (backpack or tote) that can carry daily essentials (notebook, planner, wallet, pencils, water, etc.) and that also has the capability to carry a 13"" laptop (I don't have one currently but may be getting one in the near future.) My major doesn't require me to carry heavy textbooks regularly, and when I do have one I carry it in my hands, so that's not a concern of mine. I prefer simplistic, classic pieces with a casual yet put-together vibe. I want something that is fashionable and will pair well with a laid back outfit and if I'm wearing something dressy/casual too. I've narrowed this down to two routes/options and I'd like feedback on these brands/models! This is somewhat time-sensitive due to return policies! 





My SO recently bought the Herschel Settlement Backpack for me in the spring color palette ivory/mango/foliage, but I'm considering returning it. I was really excited for it because I have been using my largest purse for school for over a year and I really need something specifically for school. I also loved the light color pop, as most of my clothing is nuetral. First, the bag seems extremely stiff, and because I wouldn't be carrying heavy items I'm worried it wouldnt relax. The straps are also slightly uncomfortable because my shoulders are narrow and they hit my inner-arms. Also, I was disappointed to find out that the exact color scheme was one of 2 that UO picked up for spring, so I can be sure to see a lot of people with the specific pack on campus soon (petty but I'm sure you can understand haha!) More importantly though I'm skeptical about the quality and I'm disappointed in the lack of any organization in this bag. The website states that it comes with media pockets, but there is only one in an obscure location that I'd be lucky to fit a 1st generation iPod nano in nonetheless my iPhone 6. I was looking for validation or wondering if the bag would relax but I cannot find reviews on Herschel ANYWHERE online, which is a bit baffling...


Anyway, I've also been looking at Everlane products. I really like the simplicity/versatility of the tote; I'm curious about the internal organization though. I like the snap-backpack too, but I'm worried about size - I'm 5'1"" so backpacks tend to overpower me easily. I've heard great things though, and I'm eager to try the brand. 


Any insight, reviews of these bags, or suggestions about other bags would be great! Ultimately I'm trying to stay under $70.

femalefashionadvice,everlane,In depth reviews of retailers as you've shopped with them over the years?,"I thought we could do a post about the retailers we have loyally shopped with and how they have changed.

ASOS: I feel a little sad for their company. They had previously had good prices, and interesting/wearable items, but of recent times in general regarding womenswear the prices have risen significantly for designs that seem to be of lesser quality. I will say the small item I bought this year was actually satisfactory, but when I went to their chat to give feedback there was an error. I don't know if I would shop there again because there's no way to get in contact with them.

Nike: I bought their activewear in the past and it was always of excellent quality considering the price paid, but they've declined in quality buying this year. The stitching was serviceable but looked rushed, the material considerably thin. I have a 2013 hoodie of theirs which had metal eyelets and metal zips, of great construction. Many zips now are plastic. Their live chat was genuinely helpful with a question.  More and more i've found that lightly used clothes from 10-15 years ago can actually look better than brand new things of today, because the materials were high quality and held to a higher standard.

Zara: They were great for me, now they're okay. In 2019 I bought a dress that had really good tailoring, very well made. Now their clothes are much more simplistic, but cost more. I am still open to shopping with them simply because they ship within my own country so it's quite fast.

Farfetch: My favourite retailer, when I once in a long while can afford it. They ship to me via DHL which is always speedy and of a high standard. I always got things in a thick box without so much as a crease. Once, I wanted to enquire about the measurements of a suit, and when I called their phone number there wasn't any wait and I got the information I needed. It is kind of annoying when e-tailers try to avoid getting direct communication and lead you to FAQs and automatic assistants.

femalefashionadvice,reformation,"Reformation clothing ""Sustainably made in China""?","Hey guys,

So I was browsing the Reformation website, checking out a skirt and I noticed that it said ""Sustainably made in China"" in the ""Sustainability impact"" part of the description. I then saw that other items of clothing (dresses, etc) also said ""Sustainably made in China.""

Now... Is Reformation outsourcing their production? Supposedly their brand (at least in the beginning) has their own factory where seamstresses make the clothing, etc.

I was trying to find info on this and saw a post here about their racist work environment and the ""apology"" from their founder/owner.

All of this really breaks my heart because if Reformation is now making their clothing in China, are those people *truly* being payed fairly for their work? How are their work conditions?

It also makes me question their ""sustainability"", shipping clothing from China to the US and then to their customers?

This just made me question their whole brand and company, and I get the feeling that they ""sold"" their ""ideals"" for profit... Now that the brand is more popular, they probably have a ton of orders and wanted to make even more profit so they are outsourcing (or fully producing) their clothing in China.

Obviously there's nothing wrong with producing in other countries, ~~but a brand that supposedly has the ideals and morals that they have, shouldn't do that.~~ Edit 4: To clarify, what I meant by what I said here was: When I first discovered Reformation a few years ago, one of their main selling points was the fact that their clothing was produced in their local LA factory. They showed that as something they took high pride in.

For that reason only, is why I thought it was weird that they are now outsourcing, considering they had the whole ""sustainable and **locally made**"" ""label"" **as part of their brand** ***identity***, just like Lush has their ""handmade"" label behind their brand identity.

From a marketing standpoint, what a brand claims as their ""identity"" is very important, which again, is why in this ***specific*** **situation regarding Reformation**, it rose red flags in my mind.

Especially because we all now how factories can easily cover up inhumane treatment of workers, etc etc etc, for whenever they have someone coming over/an ""inspection"", and then return to ""normal.""

Edit 5: Regarding this, u/MissPandaSpark was able to put what I meant into words better than I could:

>""The general idea of ‚Äúmade in the same country‚Äù probably relates to better quality control because they are speaking the same language, have the same cultural values, and are closer for frequent factory check ups, but outsourced items can still be well made or else thousands of brands wouldn‚Äôt have the reputation they have now.""

Once again, I deeply apologise, that isn't my personal view, feelings, or beliefs, at all.",1591834083.0,"Reformation clothing ""Sustainably made in China""? Hey guys,

So I was browsing the Reformation website, checking out a skirt and I noticed that it said ""Sustainably made in China"" in the ""Sustainability impact"" part of the description. I then saw that other items of clothing (dresses, etc) also said ""Sustainably made in China.""

Now... Is Reformation outsourcing their production? Supposedly their brand (at least in the beginning) has their own factory where seamstresses make the clothing, etc.

I was trying to find info on this and saw a post here about their racist work environment and the ""apology"" from their founder/owner.

All of this really breaks my heart because if Reformation is now making their clothing in China, are those people *truly* being payed fairly for their work? How are their work conditions?

It also makes me question their ""sustainability"", shipping clothing from China to the US and then to their customers?

This just made me question their whole brand and company, and I get the feeling that they ""sold"" their ""ideals"" for profit... Now that the brand is more popular, they probably have a ton of orders and wanted to make even more profit so they are outsourcing (or fully producing) their clothing in China.

Obviously there's nothing wrong with producing in other countries, ~~but a brand that supposedly has the ideals and morals that they have, shouldn't do that.~~ Edit 4: To clarify, what I meant by what I said here was: When I first discovered Reformation a few years ago, one of their main selling points was the fact that their clothing was produced in their local LA factory. They showed that as something they took high pride in.

For that reason only, is why I thought it was weird that they are now outsourcing, considering they had the whole ""sustainable and **locally made**"" ""label"" **as part of their brand** ***identity***, just like Lush has their ""handmade"" label behind their brand identity.

From a marketing standpoint, what a brand claims as their ""identity"" is very important, which again, is why in this ***specific*** **situation regarding Reformation**, it rose red flags in my mind.

Especially because we all now how factories can easily cover up inhumane treatment of workers, etc etc etc, for whenever they have someone coming over/an ""inspection"", and then return to ""normal.""

Edit 5: Regarding this, u/MissPandaSpark was able to put what I meant into words better than I could:

>""The general idea of ‚Äúmade in the same country‚Äù probably relates to better quality control because they are speaking the same language, have the same cultural values, and are closer for frequent factory check ups, but outsourced items can still be well made or else thousands of brands wouldn‚Äôt have the reputation they have now.""

product mixed reviews on all fronts some of their products seem very well designed which is what makes the brand as sought out as it is but other cuts seem like derivatives of existing products that have sold well almost like lets take that sold out dress and turn it into a jumpsuit same goes for their patterns some are absolutely stunning though the more modern ones dont appeal to my tastes as much

production practices  in interviews the founder often says that she founded the company after  negative experiences with factories in china yet it turns out that ref uses chinese factories as well whose standards they say are superhigh this is fine but i wish their site was more upfront about whats made in la and whats made in china  their site lists this for some products but more others

customer service theyve taken a lot of heat on social media for issues with returns and so forth so far i havent had a problem with them though their cs team is hard to reach

edit

marketing  after looking at their site more one thing that irks me is the odd aspirational branding models holding a hand up to their faces as if theyre celebs resisting the paps captions like for the plans you should have cancelled  a few square feet of viscose isnt going to turn anyone into some uberpopular mean girl type",Positive
femalefashionadvice,reformation,Aritzia vs. Reformation - Let's talk quality! And other similar brands?,"I love Aritzia's Babaton collection. My experience with the quality of their clothes had all been great! Though the markup over the years meant that I've become way  more selective in what I buy.

Been recommended to check out Reformation. Really like that they have a petite collection. But I've never ordered from them. With the currency exchange, a very similar dress actually costs me double the price of an Aritzia dress. Not great.

I'm desperate for some summer dresses and willing to pay a bit more for good quality. Would anyone here who had experienced both Babaton and Reformation be able to share their experience in terms of clothing quality please?

If there are other quality (and perhaps even more affordable) brands similar to those that would easily fit petite people, please feel free to share.

femalefashionadvice,reformation,The Reformation Review,"  

A while back, I asked what people would think of a review of the Reformation, and a lot of folks expressed interest. Over the past five years, I‚Äôve purchased about thirty pieces from the Reformation. Of those thirty, I returned or sold ten of them, so I‚Äôd say my experience with the brand has not been uniformly positive, but positive enough for me to keep going back to the well. For reviews of specific items, you can check out [New Inspired](https://www.newinspired.com/), a blogger who includes detailed reviews of pieces from a number of different brands. Keep in mind that this review is based on the completely subjective perspective of a non-expert, and I welcome other perspectives, but having bought a range of pieces from the Reformation, here are some of my general impressions: 

Sizing/fit: One thing I like about Ref‚Äôs clothes is that I know how they fit‚ÄîI find their sizing consistent, their product measurements reliable, and the clothing true-to-size. For reference, I am 5‚Äô 8‚Äù with 34b-25-38 measurements and I wear a size 4/S in most Ref items. I take a size 6 or 28 in pants and jeans. I wear similar sizes in clothes from Topshop and H&M. I find their mini dresses to be ungodly short‚ÄîI‚Äôve been complimented on my ‚Äúshirt‚Äù when wearing Reformation mini dresses more than once‚Äîso taller shoppers may want to stick to midis and maxis. The Reformation seems to be made with women with smaller busts in mind, so larger busted women may want to proceed with caution. They do label which items are bra-friendly, but those pieces seem to be in the minority. 

Quality: Quality is more of a mixed bag. With the caveat that I am hardly an expert on clothing construction, I‚Äôve been happy with the construction of the pieces I‚Äôve bought from the Reformation‚Äîmany items are lined, zippers lay flat, and the seams are solidly stitched together. I find the quality of construction to be similar to other brands in their price range (I‚Äôm thinking Realisation and Ganni, in particular). However, I‚Äôm not crazy about a lot of the fabrics they use. I actually avoid their viscose fabrics because I find that they wrinkle if you look at them the wrong way and they hold onto odors. Also, viscose isn‚Äôt a fabric that holds up well over time, and for the price, I‚Äôd prefer something that lasts. That being said, I do have a couple of their viscose pieces, just because I love the design/print so much, but again, I generally avoid those fabrics. Their deadstock fabrics can be iffy, too‚ÄîI have a t-shirt dress from the Reformation that is badly pilling, although in their defense, I‚Äôve worn it to death. I‚Äôve learned to avoid items with plaids and stripes because the patterns don‚Äôt often line up well. I do like their linen, denim, and Tencel items quite a bit, and these are the pieces I gravitate towards. I have a few Tencel turtlenecks from the Reformation that I wear pretty much constantly in the fall, and they‚Äôve held up very nicely over the past couple of years. I have one pair of jeans from their Ref Jeans line, and I love them, but I‚Äôve only worn them a couple times, so I can‚Äôt speak to how well they last over time. 

Care: Care instructions for Ref pieces are a pain in the ass‚Äîmost of them specify dry clean only (which kind of negates the environmental cred their trying to build) or hand wash only. I am lazy, so I usually put hand washables in a delicates bag and throw them in my washing machine on the hand wash cycle, and then lay them to dry on my drying rack. I usually use Dryel for the dry clean only items, and take them to the dry cleaner after a few wears. So far, most of my Reformation pieces have held up well, with the exception of the aforementioned t-shirt dress, so my slothfulness has been rewarded. 

Ethics: Yeah, I know, I know‚Äîno ethical consumption under capitalism. But a bourgeois pig-dog has to look her best, and from the research I‚Äôve done, the Reformation does seem to have some pretty decent business practices. However, as mentioned before, when a company produces mostly dry clean only clothes, you have to wonder a little about their commitment to the environment. You can read more from [Good on You](https://goodonyou.eco/how-ethical-is-reformation/).

Style: I get a cubic assload of compliments when I wear stuff from the Reformation. It‚Äôs cute stuff. One issue I have with some of their stock is that they tend to include annoying cut outs or other random design elements that make the piece less wearable, but they have so many designs, I still find it pretty easy to find stuff to put on my wishlist.

So, is the Reformation worth it? That all depends on your budget and lifestyle, of course, but overall, I would say yes, with some caveats. I would probably avoid their viscose pieces unless you‚Äôre head over heels for the style or you can find them second-hand or on sale. Fortunately, the Reformation has good customer service, and shipping and returns are free in the US, so the risk level is low. The Reformation pieces can frequently be found second hand on Ebay, Poshmark, Depop, and the Real Real, and with more online shops carrying them (like Nordstrom, Shopbop, and Net-a-Porter), you‚Äôre more likely to find Ref pieces on sale. The Reformation also has a high resale value, and if you‚Äôre someone who likes to refresh your wardrobe fairly regularly, that is a definite plus. I‚Äôve purchased items final sale on the Reformation website that I didn‚Äôt like, and was able to recoup my full cost by selling them on Depop. Their linen, Tencel, cotton, and denim are a better bet, especially because you can find many items made out of those fabrics in their lower-cost Ref Jeans line.",1563303466.0,"The Reformation Review

femalefashionadvice,reformation,Reformation Customer Service,"Hi y‚Äôall! 

I just want to go on a rant and follow that with a question. I‚Äôd like to see if I‚Äôm not alone in this. 

I‚Äôve bought from Reformation over the past two years. Because they aren‚Äôt inexpensive and because I ADORE their clothing, I‚Äôve spent well over $3k (maybe more) which IMO is a lot of money spent on one particular brand. 

I have never dealt with their customer service up until recently and needless to say I‚Äôm beyond disappointed/heart broken. 

I pre-ordered a skirt in early December for it to arrive early January. Apparently the item was delivered, but I never received it. I texted them and explained that I never received the package, so I asked if they could mail me a new one. They told me they were unable to! They specified they can only refund me and that if I was to ‚Äúlose‚Äù another package to the same address, that they could no longer refund me. 

I was LIVID. I‚Äôve spent thousands on this one brand and not only can they not send me the skirt I ordered, but they told me if this happens again they cannot refund me? SAY WHAT. 

Second negative experience: I have a $250 dress I ordered for a friend before this skirt incident. It didn‚Äôt fit her, so she emailed them with the order number asking if they can send her a size bigger/ if she can get something else/ if I can receive a refund once she sends it back. They said their system isn‚Äôt working, so they can only send a gift card. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. So we HAVE to spend with them? 

I want to purchase from them, but I feel heartbroken. For someone that has never sent a single item back, has spent that much, and purchases their expensive items, I would figure they would have exceptional customer service. You purchase one pair of Gucci shoes and even if it‚Äôs been a year and you ruin them, they will fix them for you. Why can‚Äôt they just send a skirt?

i want to purchase from them but i feel heartbroken for someone that has never sent a single item back has spent that much and purchases their expensive items i would figure they would have exceptional customer service you purchase one pair of gucci shoes and even if it s been a year and you ruin them they will fix them for you why can t they just send a skirt 

has anyone experienced this with them tell me i m not the only one",Negative

femalefashionadvice,reformation,Does anyone else prefer ‚Äúcheap‚Äù clothes?,"*cheap in quotations above because I know it‚Äôs all relative

As I‚Äôve gotten older, gotten into my groove with my personal style, and as I‚Äôve started to make more money, I‚Äôve tried buying more expensive clothing with the idea of having ‚Äúfewer but better‚Äù items...but I just can‚Äôt help coming back to my old, affordable (for me) standbys. I either don‚Äôt like the items as much, or I don‚Äôt notice a discernible difference in quality to where I think it‚Äôs a good value for my money. I‚Äôm also pretty much exclusively shopping online right now due to the pandemic, so it‚Äôs harder to tell if an item is really worth the higher price tag without seeing the quality in person, being able to try on, etc. 

For example, I wanted to invest in a good pair of jeans recently, and after reading lots of reviews, carefully taking my measurements, really thinking about my decision...I bought a new pair of jeans from GRLFRND for about $100 on sale. I picked a pair of 100% cotton jeans with the idea of ‚Äúfewer but better‚Äù/‚Äúbuy it for life‚Äù in mind, but when I got these jeans in the mail & tried them on...I hated them. They technically ‚Äúfit‚Äù but they were so uncomfortable and unflattering. I guess these are the kinds of jeans I need to ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm a new mom and I need my clothes to be comfy right away. So back to my American Eagle jeans I go. 

I‚Äôm still trying to buy less overall and buy more ‚Äúclassic‚Äù pieces that I‚Äôll get lots of wears out of, but I guess I just have cheap taste? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I also want to add a few asides:
-I‚Äôve noticed that brands which I use to think of as ‚Äúnicer‚Äù/‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù from which I could previously only afford heavily discounted items have gone wayyy down in quality over the years. I have a few old items from The Gap and J Crew which I purchased over 10 years ago that still hold up nicely, that are well-stitched, made of high-quality fabric, etc... the last time I got new items from these stores I was disappointed to find they pretty much felt like Forever 21 quality to me. I‚Äôm personally bummed because I can finally afford whatever I want from these stores but the quality has gone downhill. 
-Buying from ‚Äúethical‚Äù companies also seems impossible because apparently they‚Äôre all problematic? Like all the recent stuff coming out about how bad Everlane, Reformation, and Los Angeles Apparel are, among others.

Does anyone else prefer cheaper clothes?

I know I personally have been struggling to find high quality, basic long sleeve tops. Especially when most of my shopping is online and I can‚Äôt guarantee the quality of the material.

femalefashionadvice,reformation,I did a visual wardrobe and now I am so tired.,"Oof, okay, I'm going to take a while typing this post, so here's hoping it meets all the rules!

I'm about to move to a new apartment, and I'm taking the opportunity to review my wardrobe and maybe downsize a little before the move (but I'm not looking to totally decimate my wardrobe, or anything). Definitely interested in feedback!

[Visual wardrobe link](https://imgur.com/a/clxPMVu) \- maybe semi-NSFW because there's a couple bodysuits in there w/ no pants. (Also - I don't own two identical Riverdale shirts, I just accidentally put it in there twice).

If it's helpful, here are some points of reference for what I'm going for, but I have mixed feelings about some of the looks they post: [Luanna](https://www.instagram.com/luanna/), [Gemma Stafford](https://www.instagram.com/gemstafford/), [Amy Valentine](https://www.instagram.com/amyvalentinex/), [Meghan Ceallaigh](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwBM8kBgN2S/), [Mariana Fernandes](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvw9skKnZ3D/) (and as a related question - if you have any recommendations for similar IG accounts that are less... uh... caucasian... I'd appreciate it).

I'm still in the review process and welcome any input you have, but here are my early takeaways:

1. **I'm trying to look more intentional, but the items that ""spark joy"" are not my nicest items.**  
I'm generally not much of a Marie Kondo gal, but while I was trying everything on, I definitely felt more joy holding some items than others. I love all my stupid band and graphic tees more than I thought I did, so the ongoing puzzle is figuring out how to wear those and look a little less sloppy. [Using this photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKYenaHIP0/) as a reference to take care of this point as well as my next problem, which is...
2. **I have no idea how to wear dresses and skirts.**  
I own a lot of dresses, and I thought I had moved past the immature skate punk ""Dresses are gross!"" attitude of my youth, but trying all of these on revealed how rarely I wear dresses. I just wore dresses and skirts every day in April, and it was HARD, and I didn't like it. On the one hand, I'm going to just embrace that I'm a pants gal. On the other hand, I'd like to get better at wearing dresses and skirts.
3. **A subset of the previous point - I own three almost identical black skirts**.  
Whoops!
4. **A lot of these pieces** ***should*** **give me the outfits I want, which means I'm not styling/accessorizing them as well as I could.**   
I thought I didn't have the right clothes to achieve my desired look, but it turns out, there's a lot of the right stuff here. [My outfit](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuphmbanCUo/) is pretty similar to [Luanna's outfit here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwUxMEQhnKD/), but hers is accessorized way more intentionally (unrelated - in general, her outfits are tailored like perfectly to her body, and I don't know how to get to that point! I go to tailors and stuff, but I never get my pants that hi-rise. Kills me). I've really been trying to dress better, but boy oh boy I still have a lot to learn!
5. **A subset of the previous point - I gotta get better accessories.**  
I didn't include any accessories in here because I don't really like the ones I have. This is where I can definitely do the biggest purge when I move. Also, I'm trying to buy less stuff this year, and I won't feel as wasteful buying jewelry as I would, like, another crop top.
6. **I like my fits overall, but some items aren't doing me any favors.**  
At least getting rid of A20, C8, E1, E5, E6, F11, F20, G4, H1, H3, H11, L19, N8, and N2. I picked up a copy of The Curated Closet, and I'm going to use that to review the rest of these items.
7. **I have a lot of pieces that aren't really intentional with what they want to be.**  
I'm talking here about sweaters that aren't really oversize or regular, pants that aren't really high-waisted or not, tees that aren't really fitted or baggy. I'm going to need to figure out how to either style them or alter them, and if neither of those is an option, obviously I'll have to get rid of them.
8. **Many of these items were purchased when I worked in an office, and now that I've decided I'll never work in an office again, I need to figure out what's still useful to me.**  
Looking at you, cardigans L1 and L2.  Shirt C6 - you're on thin ice.

Thanks for reading everything! Would love to hear your thoughts about what I should add or eliminate, or how you think I should be styling things. [This is my OOTD finsta](https://www.instagram.com/nickyc_ootd/), if you want to see where I'm at now.

Also, I work out 6 times a week. I'm in really good shape.

femalefashionadvice,reformation,Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?,"This week, model Owen Mooney posted a video describing an incident in which Alexander Wang sexual harassed him at a night club. Instagram's [Diet Prada](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJXMxJ-Fyoi/) reposted a round-up of similar stories shared to Mooney (mostly anonymous) that showcase a pattern of predatory sexual harassment, from groping to actual drugging, by Alexander Wang. I can't seem to find any news sources that have picked up the piece yet and no statement has been made from Alexander Wang or his company.

---

Prepare for some word salad.


Over the past few years, we've seen Me Too movement make its way through the fashion industry, mostly aimed at prominent photographers (Terry Richardson, Mario Testino, Patrick Demarchelier and Bruce Webber) and fast fashion suits (Philip Green, Ed Rezak), but high fashion designers have been left fairly unscathed - until now? 

Perhaps [Prabal Gurung's](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/2/15/16995962/prabal-gurung-fashion-pregnancy-me-too) sexist attacks against pregnant employees got some attention, but had no visible impact on his career. No other media outlets have picked this up yet. So will Alexander Wang continue to show in NYFW, just as Gurung has?

Furthermore, tons of brands were exposed for racially discriminatory practices this past summer (Reformation, Zimmerman, Man Repeller, Aritzia, Everlane, Outdoor Voices, just to name a few). Aside from D&G's disastrously racist Shanghai campaign a few years back, in all other scenarios, most of these brands seemed to have had a sacrificial lamb to fire, but now continue to operate as per usual without much detriment to their brand image. 

Why is it that companies and bad actors within the fashion industry seem to get off with a light wrist slap, in comparison to others? Is sexism, racism, and harassment just too pervasively integrated within the industry? Or is the industry in itself too exclusive for mass backlash? Did these scandals make any difference in your shopping habits? For how long?

And lastly - what does it say about the state of the industry when we have an _exceptionally_ oversaturated media landscape dedicated to shilling us upcoming micro-trends, yet the most reliable source for breaking _actual news about the industry_ is an independent Instagram account ran by 3 people? Not to say DP is perfect - it's not - but they are the most fearless in their call out culture.",1609225274.0,"Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?

Mods, please delete if this isn't allowed and I apologize. I'd love to get a thread going about designer ""dupes."" I don't mean designers or manufacturers that shamelessly copy from other designers and sell it as their own, but brands or specific items that captures the overall ""aesthetic"" or vibe of another more expensive brand for less.

For example, I love Reformation and Realisation Par and have ordered from both many times. I have a hard time finding anything with the same quality construction or attention to detail as these two brands (ie. I know I can get a floral mini dress off Asos, but it's not going to be silk or sturdy linen, the back zipper won't lay as flat, etc). I'm about to bite the bullet on a dress from Eggie who is also based out of LA, but I'm unfamiliar with the company and a bit nervous. I would love to find other brands that do feminine, slightly sexy summer dresses with good construction that fit TTS (and of course it's a bonus if it's a little more budget friendly).

femalefashionadvice,allbirds,Updating An Outdated Wardrobe. Part 2: Office wear,"I‚Äôd like to first thank everybody for the great feedback on the first part of this series, I‚Äôm glad so many of you found it helpful! One of the more requested categories was office wear, so that‚Äôs what I wanted to tackle next. 
¬†
¬†





The thing about office wear is that it changes more slowly than casual wear. That means you get more mileage out of your clothes, and you have to think about it less. However, ‚Äúchanges slowly‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúnever‚Äù. Of course, you may be entirely uninterested in that and in upgrading your work look. And **that‚Äôs 100% fine**. 
¬†
¬†





*However.*
¬†
¬†
¬†




IF you would like to remain current, there are tweaks that you can eventually make in your work wardrobe. 
¬†
¬†






I want to specifically point out that this is not meant to focus on looking TRENDY, but on looking CURRENT. These are not cutting edge trends, these are not trends worn by 18 year-olds. They‚Äôre styles that are more updated than, say, 2010 - 2016 office wear. 
¬†
¬†






Please keep in mind that updating your work wardrobe DOES NOT mean:
¬†
¬†
¬†




‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That you need to throw out all your existing wardrobe
¬†





¬†
‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That you need to dress in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúyou‚Äù 
¬†
¬†






‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That you‚Äôre trying to dress ‚Äúlike a teenager‚Äù or in any way non ‚Äúage-appropriate‚Äù
¬†
¬†






‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That you‚Äôre a slave to trends
¬†
¬†






‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That your wardrobe will now be ‚Äúunflattering‚Äù
¬†
¬†





¬†
Updating your wardrobe DOES mean: 
¬†
¬†





¬†
‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Assessing your current wardrobe with a critical eye and identifying what works and what doesn‚Äôt
¬†







¬†
‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Taking a look at more current/modern fashion styles and picking out some elements that would work for your tastes/wardrobe
¬†
¬†







‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Setting some goals for what your ideal wardrobe/look/message is
¬†
¬†








‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† TRYING THINGS ON before forming an opinion on new styles
¬†








¬†
‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Planning your wardrobe for the next few years and making strategic changes/purchases
¬†
¬†
¬†






*Another thing I want to insist on is that everybody‚Äôs workplace is different.* That means different expectations, levels of formality, dress codes, and rules. *Every idea/example will not suit EVERY workplace and every dress code.* 
¬†
¬†




¬†
I‚Äôm not mandating anything here. I‚Äôm simply reporting on what‚Äôs current and what isn‚Äôt, *for those who are interested*. I tried to include outfits and ideas that run the gamut of formality. It‚Äôs up to you to assess which ones would fit your needs and which are inappropriate. 
¬†
¬†





¬†
You also do not need to make ALL the changes. I‚Äôm including examples of different clothes and elements, how they may have changed over the years, and what is their more current version, compared to what was fashionable a few years ago. But it‚Äôs up to you to swap the elements that make sense for you and that fit in your wardrobe. No one‚Äôs telling you to change everything from head to toe, unless that‚Äôs what you want! 
¬†




¬†
¬†
###The Basics
¬†
¬†





¬†
Most people aren‚Äôt looking to reinvent the wheel when it comes to workwear, and that‚Äôs fair. The workplace is not (usually) a fashion show - unless you work IN fashion or an otherwise creative field. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt look modern and current, if that‚Äôs what you want. Even if you‚Äôre keeping your outfits basic, there is still room to update, upgrade, and style an outfit that‚Äôs as simple and ‚Äútimeless‚Äù as a white shirt and black pants. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
##The blazer
¬†
¬†

¬†
¬†






¬†
The jackets we‚Äôre currently seeing are longer and roomier than jackets of yesteryear, more menswear-inspired OR a very snatched-waist Balmain-inspired look that‚Äôs come in over the past few years, with an emphasis on power shoulders and a contrast with a smaller waist. The straight cut jacket is long (sometimes even covering the butt), double-breasted, and can be oversized. The new crop of jackets are shorter, go in at the waist, and are either single button or have a single row of buttons, a la [Dior Bar Jacket](https://www.dior.com/couture/var/dior/storage/images/folder-media/folder-productpage/folder-crossselllook/folder-femme/folder-winter-22/block-f_22_4_look_096/35141174-1-eng-GB/f_22_4_look_096_1440_1200.jpg). 
¬†
¬†
¬†



If you feel like your office is too casual for a blazer, you can opt for a more casual material than the classic black suiting. Tweed is always a good choice, you can go for wool, and for a jacket that is patterned, rather than solid-colored. That‚Äôs going to look less formal. Suit vests have also been very fashionable in recent years, and they can be a good alternative if a blazer feels too stuffy or is Too Much for your office. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
##The button down shirt
¬†
¬†





Some examples:
¬†







[shirt 1](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/plus-size-fashion-button-down-1660773267.jpg?crop=0.770xw:0.867xh;0.141xw,0.133xh&resize=980:*)

¬†
¬†
¬†





¬†
Despite what ‚Äútimeless classics‚Äù bloggers would have you believe, a (white) shirt is not, in fact, timeless. Nothing is. Allow me to explain. Yes, the concept of wearing a white shirt will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù because that‚Äôs not how fashion works. An entire category of clothes rarely goes out of style. However, **the specific characteristics** of a shirt can, and do become outdated. Things like the shape and size of the collar, the cuffs, the buttons, and the length and the shape itself are all very specific to a certain era.
¬†
¬†





¬†
The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù white shirt from 2003 is tight, short (because it was worn untucked), oftentimes with an oversized and pointy collar and cuffs. The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù white shirt from 2010 is longer and straighter, with a tunic collar that does not button up, occasionally meant to be worn with a wide belt on top to emphasize the waist. It was meant to be worn untucked, on top of tight pants. The sleeves had tabs that buttoned up to keep your sleeves rolled up around elbow-level. There might have been some square pockets that were placed too high. We also saw more long, empire-waist tunic-type shirts in this 2008-2012-ish period. 
¬†
¬†
¬†





The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù white shirt from 2023 is a generous cut that‚Äôs long enough to tuck into your pants or skirt, but not long enough to cover your butt. It should end around your hip. That means that you can also wear it untucked, over your pants, without it looking frumpy. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
Seeing as the fashion is moving towards tighter and shorter shirts (no, we‚Äôre not talking about crop tops) to go with the wider bottoms, you can also expect to find more body-conforming shirts in the near future. Shirts with a marked waist, princess seams, and generally a variety of tops that go in at the waist. The blazers and jackets with tapered waists are already present, so we can expect the shirts to not lag too far behind.
¬†
¬†





¬†
##The pants
¬†
¬†





¬†

¬†




¬†
###Slacks
¬†
¬†
¬†


¬†
The current standard cut for a pair of office slacks (including suits) is a high-waisted straight leg or wide leg pair of pants, usually full length. Cropped, ankle length pants are still encountered, but usually in culotte, or wide styles, less so skinny pants. The high-waisted cigarette pants (or carrot leg, or peg leg) are still out there, but the style is meant to be a little roomier in the butt and thighs; the office is not the place for your tightest pair of pants. These often come in a paperbag waist style, which is very flattering on a lot of body types, as well as comfortable - because the belt is adjustable. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
The rise is getting lower, however, as low rise is coming back into fashion, meaning that you should be able to find midrise and lowrise pants in wide cuts if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been waiting for. That won‚Äôt change much for footwear, but it might trigger some changes in terms of tops, depending on what styles you‚Äôre wearing now. If you were used to tucking shirts into high waisted pants, a low waist doesn‚Äôt allow for that. So, you probably need to rethink and re-strategize towards a top that sits untucked, at the top of the hips, for the most traditionally harmonious proportions. 
¬†
¬†





¬†
Nowadays, a lot of pants have elasticated back waistbands, or even entirely elasticated waists or drawstring waists. [Office joggers exist](https://outfittrends.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/plus-size-interview-outfits-5.jpg.webp) for the new iteration of the more casual and relaxed post-pandemic office. Rises and cuts are encountered in generous varieties. There is no reason for a standard pair of slacks to be uncomfortable. And god, are there office pants of all varieties right now. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
(A quick note on fit: 
¬†




¬†
Even without stretch, a pair of pants that fits well should not be uncomfortable, should not pinch you anywhere, dig into your stomach, or feel tight or constricting. Size up, go for a straight or wide leg if a tight leg is constricting, and try a higher or lower rise if your waistband cuts into your stomach. Do not purchase the smallest size you can fit into. Bosquerella did [an excellent write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/s6ynwh/psa_being_told_to_size_up_is_the_advice_you_asked) on the matter you can revisit if you need the reminder. Everyone deserves pants that fit. 
¬†
¬†





¬†
Whatever type of rise you‚Äôre searching for, I recommend measuring your ideal rise from between the legs and up to where you want it to hit, whether that‚Äôs 11 inches, 14 inches, 8 inches, etc. Take a tape measure shopping if you have to. Measure the pants you‚Äôre interested in or learn to eyeball it, the name of the style doesn‚Äôt necessarily tell you anything about how they‚Äôre going to fit ON YOU, because all our bodies are different. Depending on the length of your torso, you may need a different rise than the model does. Shop for your body.)
¬†
¬†
¬†




###Stretchy pants
¬†
¬†




¬†
Leggings have never exactly been business casual, and regardless of their debatable status, they‚Äôre just not current anymore. Leggings just don‚Äôt read as polished when paired with business casual clothes, and they require a high level of effort in every other aspect of the outfit in order to elevate them and make them presentable and current in the workplace. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
The exception to this is an athleisure look in a workplace that is very casual and allows sportswear. Think tech or non client-facing roles in other industries. And speaking of leggings, let‚Äôs address their ugly stepsister, ponte pants. Despite their misleading name, they do not look like pants, let‚Äôs be honest. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
If stretchy pants are your go-to, the much better - and more modern - option is a pair of straight leg athletic fabric pants. Straight leg or flared, usually with a front seam or crease and even equipped with pockets, this version at least attempts to mimic the look of regular pants. 
¬†




¬†
¬†
##The heels
¬†
¬†





¬†
Some examples:
¬†
¬†



¬†
[heels 1](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c3/c0/72/c3c072c0a985db820ba609b7af676034.jpg)

¬†
[heels 3](https://outfittrends.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/What-to-wear-with-Mary-Jane-platform-shoes-7.png)
¬†
¬†
¬†




[heels 4](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a6/e0/58/a6e0583e3405f6b1888282c61a4a1b3c.jpg)
¬†





¬†
¬†
While there are still plenty of industries and offices where heels are common or even explicitly required, they are becoming less and less expected. The current heel has changed both in height and in shape/thickness. Thicker block heels are more current than stilettos. A patent, square mid heel will serve you well. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
Heeled mary-janes are currently the IT shoe, and there are variations on the strappy, mid heel style at many different price points. Usually patent - but also leather, for easier maintenance, or satin, for the high-maintenance dressers - mary janes are comfortable, versatile, inoffensive, and come in many different colors at the moment. Sole thickness differs, as does shape, but a lot of them follow the rounded square shape that is currently popular in footwear. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
Boots haven‚Äôt gone anywhere, either. A block heel ankle or knee high boot can be perfectly appropriate for the office, as long as the heel isn‚Äôt too high and they‚Äôre not a very irreverent design. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
##The flats

There seems to be a disconnect in mentality where a lot of people think that ‚Äútrendy‚Äù shoes can‚Äôt be comfortable. Dressing for comfort doesn‚Äôt mean you need to wear basic shoes. I‚Äôm about to say something that I know is upsetting for like, 70% of this sub, but it needs to be said: Rothys are not a modern shoe. 
¬†






¬†
More supportive shoes are in style, thankfully, and a loafer is much more current and better for your feet. The Gucci-type loafer and the trend it sparked is a little more basic and doesn‚Äôt stand out as much. It‚Äôs less of a statement, and more of a supporting character in an outfit. The platform loafers, like the Prada ones, for example, are trendier, but they‚Äôre also very comfortable. The thicker sole is very supportive and provides good shock absorption if you‚Äôre going to be walking miles in them. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
If you want to retain the ballet flat style, the modern ballet flat has a flatter, square shape and dance-inspired detailing that is meant to mimic actual ballet shoes. Pointed toe shoes are also coming back in fashion, and the most modern iteration of a pointed ballet flat is a slingback. 
¬†
¬†
¬†



Mary-janes also have a strong presence among flat shoe styles. One, two, or multi-strap, in patent, leather or canvas, for summer, mary-janes are the perfect feminine, but sophisticated shoe that can work with a variety of outfits, including pants and skirts of varying lengths.

##The bag
¬†
¬†




¬†
Some examples:

¬†
¬†






¬†
Bags for the office can be tricky, because they oftentimes have to carry your whole life, but still remain professional-looking. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why huge, unstructured bags like the LV Neverfull and the Longchamp Le Pliage were popular for so long - they‚Äôre not cute, but they‚Äôre practical. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
Thankfully, something even better came along, and that is the bizcas backpack. Carrying a laptop, your lunch, your water bottle, your umbrella, and your gym shoes on your shoulder is a one-way ticket to a messed up posture, health problems, and an expensive chiropractor bill. Choose comfort, practicality, *and* fashion by opting for a modern backpack, instead of a gaping nylon bag with thin straps that dig into your shoulder. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
Leather is the most elevated choice, but leather backpacks can be heavy, depending on size and construction, so take your time assessing the best material for your needs.

If you‚Äôre in a more formal industry that still expects a suit, the best thing you can do for your work wardrobe is to get yourself a colorful one. Suiting is huge right now - and has been for a few years - so there is no shortage of office-appropriate options that won‚Äôt bore you to death. Valentino pink is particularly prevalent as it‚Äôs one of the hot colors of the season, but Bottega green is also in, and you can find an entire range of power colors to give you that extra pop. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
If you‚Äôd rather play it more subdued, there are plenty of pastel options to choose from. Softer, more feminine, but still 100% professional, pastel suits allow you to cheer up your office wardrobe, particularly for the spring and summer seasons, as these tend to come in summer-weight fabrics. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
##The interesting top
¬†
¬†
¬†
Some examples:

¬†
¬†
¬†


¬†
If you want a look that‚Äôs more elevated, but still retains the same basic neutral top + neutral bottoms formula, all you have to do is tweak the style of the shirt. You can still keep it white, or another neutral shade, but make sure there‚Äôs an interesting design to it. You can play with shape - oversized, billowy, straight, cropped, voluminous, etc. - it‚Äôs up to you and your preferences, design details - voluminous sleeves, interesting neckline details, contrasting trims or buttons, etc., material - silk, linen, satin (very current), which also impact drape and silhouette. 
¬†
¬†
¬†



Again, color is not something you need to shy away from in the workplace, especially if you‚Äôre going to pair it with neutrals. There is nothing about colorful clothes that is inherently unprofessional (unless you work at a funeral home). If a top is professional in white, it‚Äôs also professional in blue, or magenta. A ‚Äúspicy‚Äù shirt can be the visual interest you need in an otherwise drab work outfit. 
¬†
¬†


¬†
##The midi skirt
¬†
¬†
¬†


Some examples:
¬†

[midi 8](https://blog.petitedressing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/loafers-17-473x1024.jpg)
¬†
¬†





¬†
You may have noticed that in recent years, THE skirt/dress length has been the midi. Reaching around mid calf, the midi oftentimes has a medium to long leg slit. BUT there are simpler and less sexy versions for the office. The shape is straight or conical, rather than the A-line accordion pleated midis we saw around 2016. However, it‚Äôs not the tight pencil skirt shape of the 2010s, either. Think more body-skimming, rather than a spandex-y bodycon. 
¬†
¬†
¬†




In addition to being very current, the midi is very office-friendly because of the conservative length. It goes great with heels, but it also looks good with flats, especially the more modern chunky shoes. A midi skirt can be worn with a classic button-up shirt, or a thin turtleneck, a chunky knit, a t-shirt for more casual offices, and it can even be taken out for drinks or shopping after work or on the weekend. A very versatile piece that can work hard in your wardrobe for the next few years. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
The danger with a long skirt is to not veer into frumpy, church-y territory. If you‚Äôre going for a midi look, I recommend styling it in a very intentional way, with some very modern accessories. A midi skirt with a thin-soled ballet shoe from 2012 and a long, thin cardigan might look frumpy and awkward, but a midi with a chunky loafer and an oversized blazer looks like an intentional outfit. Same with boots - forego the heeled low cut ankle boot and instead, opt for a chunky knee-high boot. It can also look very chic with a longer, oversized, chunky knit.
¬†
¬†




¬†
Another way to make sure it‚Äôs not reading frumpy is to pick a modern fabric. Leather skirts are very in right now, as are satin slip-style skirts. In the right cut and in a high-quality material, they can be professional, while still remaining stylish. 
¬†
¬†

¬†
##The sneakers
¬†
¬†



¬†
Some examples:

¬†
¬†
¬†

¬†
The main aspect people appreciate about wearing sneakers is that they are comfortable. But if you‚Äôre looking to update your work wardrobe, you should know that Allbirds-style shoes are an outdated style. A black pair *could* be somewhat neutral, especially combined with a [chic, modern all-black outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/20/30/1a/20301a413d025332047845afbb6871c8.jpg). 
¬†
¬†
¬†



But there are equally comfortable sneakers out there that are sleeker, more modern, and more professional. You don‚Äôt have to wear the chunky dad sneakers your 15 year-old is wearing, but a sleek, white sneaker with a clean shape that‚Äôs not overly stylized or embellished is a perfectly respectable choice that will bring your work style closer to 2023. No synthetic mesh, please.
¬†
¬†



¬†
If you feel like white is too stark and stands out too much as an athletic shoe, black is always a safe choice. If you can afford to be really daring in a casual office, you can even try a pair of platform converse. They‚Äôre not just more current, but they‚Äôre also much more comfortable, because the sole isn‚Äôt as thin and lacking in support as the classic version. Plus you get a tiny bit of height, even without heels. 
¬†
¬†
¬†



##The jeans
¬†
¬†


¬†
Some examples:

¬†
¬†



¬†
¬†
Jeans in the workplace were once a hotly debated matter and it may still depend entirely on your specific office. But in a post-covid world, where so many are reluctant to even go back to the office at all, dress codes have relaxed and jeans are more prevalent than ever before. And why shouldn‚Äôt they be? A good rule of thumb for wearing jeans in the office is to stick to a pair that is non-distressed, and solid-colored. No rips, stone washing, or fading and whiskering. Black, dark blue, or mid-blue are all okay colors. Maybe even white, in the summer. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
For an updated outfit, the new styles of jeans are all very workplace-friendly, because they don‚Äôt cling to the body so tightly like skinny jeans did, so they‚Äôre not emphasizing anything that an old white man might be offended by or overly taken by. There is no reason why a pair of straight leg or wide leg jeans shouldn‚Äôt pair great with a shirt, a sweater, a blazer, and a pair of loafers for a casual office environment. I‚Äôd stick to jeans that are actually hemmed, and not distressed, but at the same time, your legs are mostly under a desk, so only you know what you can get away with!
¬†
¬†



¬†
#Modernize your office fit
¬†
¬†



¬†
Finally, let‚Äôs look at some typical, average office fits you‚Äôd see 10 years ago, and how we can retain the same basic, reliable structure, but with updated pieces. Allow me to remind you that we don‚Äôt need to throw out the clothes in the outdated examples and replace them all with clothes from the updated ones! You can get more mileage out of your clothes if you mix and match with some more modern pieces. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
##sweater + black pants

¬†




¬†
¬†
The cut matters so much in an outfit, as you can see in these examples. We‚Äôre still retaining the exact same formula, but we‚Äôre simply updating the pieces. While it‚Äôs still a big, oversized gray sweater, the style becomes chunkier, with balloon sleeves. 
¬†
¬†




The black pants are flared instead of skinny, which is a more modern cut. The boots aren‚Äôt almond-toe, but pointed, and they match the other light-colored accessories. 
¬†






##¬†long top/sweater + leggings + flats

¬†
¬†






If your office is casual enough, you may still be able to get away with wearing leggings. Rather than pairing them with ballet flats, opt for a pair of sleek sneakers. You can still keep the white shirt and the knit format, but update to a chunky knit sweater, instead of the thin cardigan. Accessorizing with a big scarf indoors is unnecessary, unless it‚Äôs cold. If you want to keep the accent scarf, opt for a thinner silk square scarf, instead. 
¬†







##top + cardigan + slacks




¬†

¬†




¬†
This is a great example of how you can still wear your long cardigans in a much more modern fit. If you look at the first example, that short, tight cardigan on top of a tight top makes it look like the cardigan doesn‚Äôt fit her properly; it‚Äôs straining on her body. That‚Äôs never a flattering fit. The looser cardigan with a more generous cut in the second example allows for a more comfortable fit. 
¬†




¬†
The belt is present in both examples for waist emphasis, but tucking the top inside the pants rather than letting it hang on top is an instant update you can easily make to your everyday fit. If you prefer an untucked top, that‚Äôs perfectly fine, but choose a looser fit and not a tight jersey top. 
¬†
¬†




Accessories also irrevocably date an outfit. The chunky statement jewelry can easily be swapped for simpler pieces that subtly enhance and highlight, rather than being the focus of your overall fit. 
¬†
¬†
¬†

¬†
¬†







If you‚Äôre gonna do a knit with jeans for work, you can easily update the look. Swap the skinnies for a pair of straight leg jeans. The riding boots or ankle boots can be changed into combat boots or a chunky pair of oxfords, and the knit can be swapped for a chunkier, either cropped or oversized sweater. Or you can opt for an oversized knit vest. It‚Äôs worn over a t-shirt in this example, but it works beautifully over a long-sleeved button-up shirt, or even over a tight turtleneck. 
¬†




¬†
##dark suit + heels

¬†
¬†





¬†
The basic suit has changed shape, with slim ankle pants being less current than straight, long pants with a crease. The blazer is longer, less fitted, and more oversized, and the heels have more of a square toe (or a more elongated point), rather than the short pointed heel in the first example. 
¬†
¬†




##white shirt + jeans + flats

¬†





¬†
As you can see, sometimes it‚Äôs just a matter of styling. The two examples aren‚Äôt that different, just slightly updated. The jeans are no longer skinny, but straight-cut. It‚Äôs still a style that conforms to your shape, just more modern and less constricting. The shirt is tucked into the jeans, instead of a long, untucked shirt. We still keep flat shoes, but we choose something with a platform. 
¬†
¬†





Again, opting for minimal jewelry over the chunky, statement necklaces will instantly make your otufit feel fresher and more modern.

¬†",1678309154.0,"Updating An Outdated Wardrobe. Part 2: Office wear I‚Äôd like to first thank everybody for the great feedback on the first part of this series, I‚Äôm glad so many of you found it helpful! One of the more requested categories was office wear, so that‚Äôs what I wanted to tackle next. 
¬†
¬†





The thing about office wear is that it changes more slowly than casual wear. That means you get more mileage out of your clothes, and you have to think about it less. However, ‚Äúchanges slowly‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúnever‚Äù. Of course, you may be entirely uninterested in that and in upgrading your work look. And **that‚Äôs 100% fine**. 
¬†
¬†





*However.*
¬†
¬†
¬†




IF you would like to remain current, there are tweaks that you can eventually make in your work wardrobe. 
¬†
¬†






I want to specifically point out that this is not meant to focus on looking TRENDY, but on looking CURRENT. These are not cutting edge trends, these are not trends worn by 18 year-olds. They‚Äôre styles that are more updated than, say, 2010 - 2016 office wear. 
¬†
¬†






Please keep in mind that updating your work wardrobe DOES NOT mean:
¬†
¬†
¬†




‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That you need to throw out all your existing wardrobe
¬†





¬†
‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That you need to dress in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúyou‚Äù 
¬†
¬†






‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That you‚Äôre trying to dress ‚Äúlike a teenager‚Äù or in any way non ‚Äúage-appropriate‚Äù
¬†
¬†






‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That you‚Äôre a slave to trends
¬†
¬†






‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That your wardrobe will now be ‚Äúunflattering‚Äù
¬†
¬†





¬†
Updating your wardrobe DOES mean: 
¬†
¬†





¬†
‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Assessing your current wardrobe with a critical eye and identifying what works and what doesn‚Äôt
¬†







¬†
‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Taking a look at more current/modern fashion styles and picking out some elements that would work for your tastes/wardrobe
¬†
¬†







‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Setting some goals for what your ideal wardrobe/look/message is
¬†

‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† TRYING THINGS ON before forming an opinion on new styles
¬†








¬†
‚óè¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Planning your wardrobe for the next few years and making strategic changes/purchases
¬†
¬†
¬†






*Another thing I want to insist on is that everybody‚Äôs workplace is different.* That means different expectations, levels of formality, dress codes, and rules. *Every idea/example will not suit EVERY workplace and every dress code.* 
¬†
¬†




¬†
I‚Äôm not mandating anything here. I‚Äôm simply reporting on what‚Äôs current and what isn‚Äôt, *for those who are interested*. I tried to include outfits and ideas that run the gamut of formality. It‚Äôs up to you to assess which ones would fit your needs and which are inappropriate. 
¬†
¬†





¬†
You also do not need to make ALL the changes. I‚Äôm including examples of different clothes and elements, how they may have changed over the years, and what is their more current version, compared to what was fashionable a few years ago. But it‚Äôs up to you to swap the elements that make sense for you and that fit in your wardrobe. No one‚Äôs telling you to change everything from head to toe, unless that‚Äôs what you want! 
¬†




¬†
¬†
###The Basics
¬†
¬†





¬†
Most people aren‚Äôt looking to reinvent the wheel when it comes to workwear, and that‚Äôs fair. The workplace is not (usually) a fashion show - unless you work IN fashion or an otherwise creative field. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt look modern and current, if that‚Äôs what you want. Even if you‚Äôre keeping your outfits basic, there is still room to update, upgrade, and style an outfit that‚Äôs as simple and ‚Äútimeless‚Äù as a white shirt and black pants. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
##The blazer

¬†
The jackets we‚Äôre currently seeing are longer and roomier than jackets of yesteryear, more menswear-inspired OR a very snatched-waist Balmain-inspired look that‚Äôs come in over the past few years, with an emphasis on power shoulders and a contrast with a smaller waist. The straight cut jacket is long (sometimes even covering the butt), double-breasted, and can be oversized. The new crop of jackets are shorter, go in at the waist, and are either single button or have a single row of buttons, a la [Dior Bar Jacket](https://www.dior.com/couture/var/dior/storage/images/folder-media/folder-productpage/folder-crossselllook/folder-femme/folder-winter-22/block-f_22_4_look_096/35141174-1-eng-GB/f_22_4_look_096_1440_1200.jpg). 
¬†
¬†
¬†



If you feel like your office is too casual for a blazer, you can opt for a more casual material than the classic black suiting. Tweed is always a good choice, you can go for wool, and for a jacket that is patterned, rather than solid-colored. That‚Äôs going to look less formal. Suit vests have also been very fashionable in recent years, and they can be a good alternative if a blazer feels too stuffy or is Too Much for your office. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
##The button down shirt
¬†
¬†





Some examples:
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†





¬†
Despite what ‚Äútimeless classics‚Äù bloggers would have you believe, a (white) shirt is not, in fact, timeless. Nothing is. Allow me to explain. Yes, the concept of wearing a white shirt will never be ‚Äúdated‚Äù because that‚Äôs not how fashion works. An entire category of clothes rarely goes out of style. However, **the specific characteristics** of a shirt can, and do become outdated. Things like the shape and size of the collar, the cuffs, the buttons, and the length and the shape itself are all very specific to a certain era.
¬†
¬†





¬†
The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù white shirt from 2003 is tight, short (because it was worn untucked), oftentimes with an oversized and pointy collar and cuffs. The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù white shirt from 2010 is longer and straighter, with a tunic collar that does not button up, occasionally meant to be worn with a wide belt on top to emphasize the waist. It was meant to be worn untucked, on top of tight pants. The sleeves had tabs that buttoned up to keep your sleeves rolled up around elbow-level. There might have been some square pockets that were placed too high. We also saw more long, empire-waist tunic-type shirts in this 2008-2012-ish period. 
¬†
¬†
¬†





The ‚Äúclassic‚Äù white shirt from 2023 is a generous cut that‚Äôs long enough to tuck into your pants or skirt, but not long enough to cover your butt. It should end around your hip. That means that you can also wear it untucked, over your pants, without it looking frumpy. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
Seeing as the fashion is moving towards tighter and shorter shirts (no, we‚Äôre not talking about crop tops) to go with the wider bottoms, you can also expect to find more body-conforming shirts in the near future. Shirts with a marked waist, princess seams, and generally a variety of tops that go in at the waist. The blazers and jackets with tapered waists are already present, so we can expect the shirts to not lag too far behind.
¬†
¬†





¬†
##The pants
¬†
¬†

¬†
###Slacks
¬†
¬†
¬†


¬†
The current standard cut for a pair of office slacks (including suits) is a high-waisted straight leg or wide leg pair of pants, usually full length. Cropped, ankle length pants are still encountered, but usually in culotte, or wide styles, less so skinny pants. The high-waisted cigarette pants (or carrot leg, or peg leg) are still out there, but the style is meant to be a little roomier in the butt and thighs; the office is not the place for your tightest pair of pants. These often come in a paperbag waist style, which is very flattering on a lot of body types, as well as comfortable - because the belt is adjustable. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
The rise is getting lower, however, as low rise is coming back into fashion, meaning that you should be able to find midrise and lowrise pants in wide cuts if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been waiting for. That won‚Äôt change much for footwear, but it might trigger some changes in terms of tops, depending on what styles you‚Äôre wearing now. If you were used to tucking shirts into high waisted pants, a low waist doesn‚Äôt allow for that. So, you probably need to rethink and re-strategize towards a top that sits untucked, at the top of the hips, for the most traditionally harmonious proportions. 
¬†
¬†





¬†
Nowadays, a lot of pants have elasticated back waistbands, or even entirely elasticated waists or drawstring waists. [Office joggers exist](https://outfittrends.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/plus-size-interview-outfits-5.jpg.webp) for the new iteration of the more casual and relaxed post-pandemic office. Rises and cuts are encountered in generous varieties. There is no reason for a standard pair of slacks to be uncomfortable. And god, are there office pants of all varieties right now. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
(A quick note on fit: 
¬†




¬†
Even without stretch, a pair of pants that fits well should not be uncomfortable, should not pinch you anywhere, dig into your stomach, or feel tight or constricting. Size up, go for a straight or wide leg if a tight leg is constricting, and try a higher or lower rise if your waistband cuts into your stomach. Do not purchase the smallest size you can fit into. Bosquerella did [an excellent write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/s6ynwh/psa_being_told_to_size_up_is_the_advice_you_asked) on the matter you can revisit if you need the reminder. Everyone deserves pants that fit. 
¬†
¬†





¬†
Whatever type of rise you‚Äôre searching for, I recommend measuring your ideal rise from between the legs and up to where you want it to hit, whether that‚Äôs 11 inches, 14 inches, 8 inches, etc. Take a tape measure shopping if you have to. Measure the pants you‚Äôre interested in or learn to eyeball it, the name of the style doesn‚Äôt necessarily tell you anything about how they‚Äôre going to fit ON YOU, because all our bodies are different. Depending on the length of your torso, you may need a different rise than the model does. Shop for your body.)
¬†
¬†
¬†




###Stretchy pants
¬†
¬†




¬†
Leggings have never exactly been business casual, and regardless of their debatable status, they‚Äôre just not current anymore. Leggings just don‚Äôt read as polished when paired with business casual clothes, and they require a high level of effort in every other aspect of the outfit in order to elevate them and make them presentable and current in the workplace. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
The exception to this is an athleisure look in a workplace that is very casual and allows sportswear. Think tech or non client-facing roles in other industries. And speaking of leggings, let‚Äôs address their ugly stepsister, ponte pants. Despite their misleading name, they do not look like pants, let‚Äôs be honest. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
If stretchy pants are your go-to, the much better - and more modern - option is a pair of straight leg athletic fabric pants. Straight leg or flared, usually with a front seam or crease and even equipped with pockets, this version at least attempts to mimic the look of regular pants. 
¬†




¬†
¬†
##The heels
¬†
¬†





¬†
Some examples:
¬†
¬†



¬†
[heels 1](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c3/c0/72/c3c072c0a985db820ba609b7af676034.jpg)

¬†
¬†
¬†




[heels 4](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a6/e0/58/a6e0583e3405f6b1888282c61a4a1b3c.jpg)
¬†





¬†
¬†
While there are still plenty of industries and offices where heels are common or even explicitly required, they are becoming less and less expected. The current heel has changed both in height and in shape/thickness. Thicker block heels are more current than stilettos. A patent, square mid heel will serve you well. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
Heeled mary-janes are currently the IT shoe, and there are variations on the strappy, mid heel style at many different price points. Usually patent - but also leather, for easier maintenance, or satin, for the high-maintenance dressers - mary janes are comfortable, versatile, inoffensive, and come in many different colors at the moment. Sole thickness differs, as does shape, but a lot of them follow the rounded square shape that is currently popular in footwear. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
Boots haven‚Äôt gone anywhere, either. A block heel ankle or knee high boot can be perfectly appropriate for the office, as long as the heel isn‚Äôt too high and they‚Äôre not a very irreverent design. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
##The flats
¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
Some examples:
¬†
¬†

¬†
¬†






There seems to be a disconnect in mentality where a lot of people think that ‚Äútrendy‚Äù shoes can‚Äôt be comfortable. Dressing for comfort doesn‚Äôt mean you need to wear basic shoes. I‚Äôm about to say something that I know is upsetting for like, 70% of this sub, but it needs to be said: Rothys are not a modern shoe. 
¬†






¬†
More supportive shoes are in style, thankfully, and a loafer is much more current and better for your feet. The Gucci-type loafer and the trend it sparked is a little more basic and doesn‚Äôt stand out as much. It‚Äôs less of a statement, and more of a supporting character in an outfit. The platform loafers, like the Prada ones, for example, are trendier, but they‚Äôre also very comfortable. The thicker sole is very supportive and provides good shock absorption if you‚Äôre going to be walking miles in them. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
If you want to retain the ballet flat style, the modern ballet flat has a flatter, square shape and dance-inspired detailing that is meant to mimic actual ballet shoes. Pointed toe shoes are also coming back in fashion, and the most modern iteration of a pointed ballet flat is a slingback. 
¬†
¬†
¬†



Mary-janes also have a strong presence among flat shoe styles. One, two, or multi-strap, in patent, leather or canvas, for summer, mary-janes are the perfect feminine, but sophisticated shoe that can work with a variety of outfits, including pants and skirts of varying lengths. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
##The bag
¬†
¬†




¬†
Some examples:
¬†

¬†
¬†






¬†
Bags for the office can be tricky, because they oftentimes have to carry your whole life, but still remain professional-looking. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why huge, unstructured bags like the LV Neverfull and the Longchamp Le Pliage were popular for so long - they‚Äôre not cute, but they‚Äôre practical. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
Thankfully, something even better came along, and that is the bizcas backpack. Carrying a laptop, your lunch, your water bottle, your umbrella, and your gym shoes on your shoulder is a one-way ticket to a messed up posture, health problems, and an expensive chiropractor bill. Choose comfort, practicality, *and* fashion by opting for a modern backpack, instead of a gaping nylon bag with thin straps that dig into your shoulder. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
Leather is the most elevated choice, but leather backpacks can be heavy, depending on size and construction, so take your time assessing the best material for your needs. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
###Fun/casual/out of the box alternatives
¬†
¬†
¬†



##The colorful suit
¬†
¬†
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†



If you‚Äôre in a more formal industry that still expects a suit, the best thing you can do for your work wardrobe is to get yourself a colorful one. Suiting is huge right now - and has been for a few years - so there is no shortage of office-appropriate options that won‚Äôt bore you to death. Valentino pink is particularly prevalent as it‚Äôs one of the hot colors of the season, but Bottega green is also in, and you can find an entire range of power colors to give you that extra pop. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
If you‚Äôd rather play it more subdued, there are plenty of pastel options to choose from. Softer, more feminine, but still 100% professional, pastel suits allow you to cheer up your office wardrobe, particularly for the spring and summer seasons, as these tend to come in summer-weight fabrics. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
##The interesting top
¬†
¬†
¬†
Some examples:
¬†
¬†

¬†[top7](https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/black-jeans-outfit-blouse-and-block-heels.png?fit=728%2C921)
¬†
¬†
¬†


¬†
If you want a look that‚Äôs more elevated, but still retains the same basic neutral top + neutral bottoms formula, all you have to do is tweak the style of the shirt. You can still keep it white, or another neutral shade, but make sure there‚Äôs an interesting design to it. You can play with shape - oversized, billowy, straight, cropped, voluminous, etc. - it‚Äôs up to you and your preferences, design details - voluminous sleeves, interesting neckline details, contrasting trims or buttons, etc., material - silk, linen, satin (very current), which also impact drape and silhouette. 
¬†
¬†
¬†



Again, color is not something you need to shy away from in the workplace, especially if you‚Äôre going to pair it with neutrals. There is nothing about colorful clothes that is inherently unprofessional (unless you work at a funeral home). If a top is professional in white, it‚Äôs also professional in blue, or magenta. A ‚Äúspicy‚Äù shirt can be the visual interest you need in an otherwise drab work outfit.

¬†
You may have noticed that in recent years, THE skirt/dress length has been the midi. Reaching around mid calf, the midi oftentimes has a medium to long leg slit. BUT there are simpler and less sexy versions for the office. The shape is straight or conical, rather than the A-line accordion pleated midis we saw around 2016. However, it‚Äôs not the tight pencil skirt shape of the 2010s, either. Think more body-skimming, rather than a spandex-y bodycon. 
¬†
¬†
¬†




In addition to being very current, the midi is very office-friendly because of the conservative length. It goes great with heels, but it also looks good with flats, especially the more modern chunky shoes. A midi skirt can be worn with a classic button-up shirt, or a thin turtleneck, a chunky knit, a t-shirt for more casual offices, and it can even be taken out for drinks or shopping after work or on the weekend. A very versatile piece that can work hard in your wardrobe for the next few years. 
¬†
¬†




¬†
The danger with a long skirt is to not veer into frumpy, church-y territory. If you‚Äôre going for a midi look, I recommend styling it in a very intentional way, with some very modern accessories. A midi skirt with a thin-soled ballet shoe from 2012 and a long, thin cardigan might look frumpy and awkward, but a midi with a chunky loafer and an oversized blazer looks like an intentional outfit. Same with boots - forego the heeled low cut ankle boot and instead, opt for a chunky knee-high boot. It can also look very chic with a longer, oversized, chunky knit.
¬†
¬†




¬†
Another way to make sure it‚Äôs not reading frumpy is to pick a modern fabric. Leather skirts are very in right now, as are satin slip-style skirts. In the right cut and in a high-quality material, they can be professional, while still remaining stylish.

##The sneakers

¬†

The main aspect people appreciate about wearing sneakers is that they are comfortable. But if you‚Äôre looking to update your work wardrobe, you should know that Allbirds-style shoes are an outdated style. A black pair *could* be somewhat neutral, especially combined with a [chic, modern all-black outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/20/30/1a/20301a413d025332047845afbb6871c8.jpg). 
¬†
¬†
¬†



But there are equally comfortable sneakers out there that are sleeker, more modern, and more professional. You don‚Äôt have to wear the chunky dad sneakers your 15 year-old is wearing, but a sleek, white sneaker with a clean shape that‚Äôs not overly stylized or embellished is a perfectly respectable choice that will bring your work style closer to 2023. No synthetic mesh, please.
¬†
¬†



¬†
If you feel like white is too stark and stands out too much as an athletic shoe, black is always a safe choice. If you can afford to be really daring in a casual office, you can even try a pair of platform converse. They‚Äôre not just more current, but they‚Äôre also much more comfortable, because the sole isn‚Äôt as thin and lacking in support as the classic version. Plus you get a tiny bit of height, even without heels.

##The jeans
¬†

¬†

¬†
¬†
Jeans in the workplace were once a hotly debated matter and it may still depend entirely on your specific office. But in a post-covid world, where so many are reluctant to even go back to the office at all, dress codes have relaxed and jeans are more prevalent than ever before. And why shouldn‚Äôt they be? A good rule of thumb for wearing jeans in the office is to stick to a pair that is non-distressed, and solid-colored. No rips, stone washing, or fading and whiskering. Black, dark blue, or mid-blue are all okay colors. Maybe even white, in the summer. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
For an updated outfit, the new styles of jeans are all very workplace-friendly, because they don‚Äôt cling to the body so tightly like skinny jeans did, so they‚Äôre not emphasizing anything that an old white man might be offended by or overly taken by. There is no reason why a pair of straight leg or wide leg jeans shouldn‚Äôt pair great with a shirt, a sweater, a blazer, and a pair of loafers for a casual office environment. I‚Äôd stick to jeans that are actually hemmed, and not distressed, but at the same time, your legs are mostly under a desk, so only you know what you can get away with!
¬†
¬†



¬†
#Modernize your office fit
¬†
¬†



¬†
Finally, let‚Äôs look at some typical, average office fits you‚Äôd see 10 years ago, and how we can retain the same basic, reliable structure, but with updated pieces. Allow me to remind you that we don‚Äôt need to throw out the clothes in the outdated examples and replace them all with clothes from the updated ones! You can get more mileage out of your clothes if you mix and match with some more modern pieces. 
¬†
¬†



¬†
##sweater + black pants

¬†




¬†
¬†
The cut matters so much in an outfit, as you can see in these examples. We‚Äôre still retaining the exact same formula, but we‚Äôre simply updating the pieces. While it‚Äôs still a big, oversized gray sweater, the style becomes chunkier, with balloon sleeves. 
¬†
¬†




The black pants are flared instead of skinny, which is a more modern cut. The boots aren‚Äôt almond-toe, but pointed, and they match the other light-colored accessories. 
¬†






##¬†long top/sweater + leggings + flats

¬†
¬†






If your office is casual enough, you may still be able to get away with wearing leggings. Rather than pairing them with ballet flats, opt for a pair of sleek sneakers. You can still keep the white shirt and the knit format, but update to a chunky knit sweater, instead of the thin cardigan. Accessorizing with a big scarf indoors is unnecessary, unless it‚Äôs cold. If you want to keep the accent scarf, opt for a thinner silk square scarf, instead. 
¬†







##top + cardigan + slacks

¬†




¬†
This is a great example of how you can still wear your long cardigans in a much more modern fit. If you look at the first example, that short, tight cardigan on top of a tight top makes it look like the cardigan doesn‚Äôt fit her properly; it‚Äôs straining on her body. That‚Äôs never a flattering fit. The looser cardigan with a more generous cut in the second example allows for a more comfortable fit. 
¬†




¬†
The belt is present in both examples for waist emphasis, but tucking the top inside the pants rather than letting it hang on top is an instant update you can easily make to your everyday fit. If you prefer an untucked top, that‚Äôs perfectly fine, but choose a looser fit and not a tight jersey top. 
¬†
¬†




Accessories also irrevocably date an outfit. The chunky statement jewelry can easily be swapped for simpler pieces that subtly enhance and highlight, rather than being the focus of your overall fit. 
¬†
¬†

¬†
¬†







If you‚Äôre gonna do a knit with jeans for work, you can easily update the look. Swap the skinnies for a pair of straight leg jeans. The riding boots or ankle boots can be changed into combat boots or a chunky pair of oxfords, and the knit can be swapped for a chunkier, either cropped or oversized sweater. Or you can opt for an oversized knit vest. It‚Äôs worn over a t-shirt in this example, but it works beautifully over a long-sleeved button-up shirt, or even over a tight turtleneck. 
¬†

¬†
¬†





¬†
The basic suit has changed shape, with slim ankle pants being less current than straight, long pants with a crease. The blazer is longer, less fitted, and more oversized, and the heels have more of a square toe (or a more elongated point), rather than the short pointed heel in the first example. 
¬†
¬†




##white shirt + jeans + flats

¬†





¬†
As you can see, sometimes it‚Äôs just a matter of styling. The two examples aren‚Äôt that different, just slightly updated. The jeans are no longer skinny, but straight-cut. It‚Äôs still a style that conforms to your shape, just more modern and less constricting. The shirt is tucked into the jeans, instead of a long, untucked shirt. We still keep flat shoes, but we choose something with a platform. 
¬†
¬†





Again, opting for minimal jewelry over the chunky, statement necklaces will instantly make your otufit feel fresher and more modern.

¬†","updating an outdated wardrobe part 2 office wear i d like to first thank everybody for the great feedback on the first part of this series i m glad so many of you found it helpful one of the more requested categories was office wear so that s what i wanted to tackle next 
 
 





the thing about office wear is that it changes more slowly than casual wear that means you get more mileage out of your clothes and you have to think about it less however  changes slowly  doesn t mean  never  of course you may be entirely uninterested in that and in upgrading your work look and that s 100 fine 
 
 





however
 
 
 




if you would like to remain current there are tweaks that you can eventually make in your work wardrobe 
 
 






i want to specifically point out that this is not meant to focus on looking trendy but on looking current these are not cutting edge trends these are not trends worn by 18 yearolds they re styles that are more updated than say 2010  2016 office wear 
 
 






please keep in mind that updating your work wardrobe does not mean
 
 
 




  that you need to throw out all your existing wardrobe
 





 
  that you need to dress in a way that doesn t feel like  you  
 
 






  that you re trying to dress  like a teenager  or in any way non  ageappropriate 
 
 






  that you re a slave to trends
 
 






  that your wardrobe will now be  unflattering 
 
 





 
updating your wardrobe does mean 
 
 





 
  assessing your current wardrobe with a critical eye and identifying what works and what doesn t
 







 
  taking a look at more currentmodern fashion styles and picking out some elements that would work for your tasteswardrobe
 
 







  setting some goals for what your ideal wardrobelookmessage is
 
 








  trying things on before forming an opinion on new styles
 








 
  planning your wardrobe for the next few years and making strategic changespurchases
 
 
 






another thing i want to insist on is that everybody s workplace is different that means different expectations levels of formality dress codes and rules every ideaexample will not suit every workplace and every dress code 
 
 




 
i m not mandating anything here i m simply reporting on what s current and what isn t for those who are interested i tried to include outfits and ideas that run the gamut of formality it s up to you to assess which ones would fit your needs and which are inappropriate 
 
 





 
you also do not need to make all the changes i m including examples of different clothes and elements how they may have changed over the years and what is their more current version compared to what was fashionable a few years ago but it s up to you to swap the elements that make sense for you and that fit in your wardrobe no one s telling you to change everything from head to toe unless that s what you want 
 




 
 
the basics
 
 





 
most people aren t looking to reinvent the wheel when it comes to workwear and that s fair the workplace is not usually a fashion show  unless you work in fashion or an otherwise creative field but that doesn t mean you can t look modern and current if that s what you want even if you re keeping your outfits basic there is still room to update upgrade and style an outfit that s as simple and  timeless  as a white shirt and black pants 
 
 




 
the blazer
 
 





some examples
 
blazer 1 
 
 





blazer 2 
 




 
blazer 3 
 
 





blazer 4 
 
 





blazer 5
 







 
blazer 6
 
 








blazer 7
 
 







blazer 8
 
 






 
the jackets we re currently seeing are longer and roomier than jackets of yesteryear more menswearinspired or a very snatchedwaist balmaininspired look that s come in over the past few years with an emphasis on power shoulders and a contrast with a smaller waist the straight cut jacket is long sometimes even covering the butt doublebreasted and can be oversized the new crop of jackets are shorter go in at the waist and are either single button or have a single row of buttons a la dior bar jacket 
 
 
 



if you feel like your office is too casual for a blazer you can opt for a more casual material than the classic black suiting tweed is always a good choice you can go for wool and for a jacket that is patterned rather than solidcolored that s going to look less formal suit vests have also been very fashionable in recent years and they can be a good alternative if a blazer feels too stuffy or is too much for your office 
 
 



 
the button down shirt
 
 





some examples
 







shirt 1
 
 
 





 
shirt 2 
 
 
 




 
shirt 3 
 
 
 





 
despite what  timeless classics  bloggers would have you believe a white shirt is not in fact timeless nothing is allow me to explain yes the concept of wearing a white shirt will never be  dated  because that s not how fashion works an entire category of clothes rarely goes out of style however the specific characteristics of a shirt can and do become outdated things like the shape and size of the collar the cuffs the buttons and the length and the shape itself are all very specific to a certain era
 
 





 
the  classic  white shirt from 2003 is tight short because it was worn untucked oftentimes with an oversized and pointy collar and cuffs the  classic  white shirt from 2010 is longer and straighter with a tunic collar that does not button up occasionally meant to be worn with a wide belt on top to emphasize the waist it was meant to be worn untucked on top of tight pants the sleeves had tabs that buttoned up to keep your sleeves rolled up around elbowlevel there might have been some square pockets that were placed too high we also saw more long empirewaist tunictype shirts in this 20082012ish period 
 
 
 





the  classic  white shirt from 2023 is a generous cut that s long enough to tuck into your pants or skirt but not long enough to cover your butt it should end around your hip that means that you can also wear it untucked over your pants without it looking frumpy 
 
 




 
seeing as the fashion is moving towards tighter and shorter shirts no we re not talking about crop tops to go with the wider bottoms you can also expect to find more bodyconforming shirts in the near future shirts with a marked waist princess seams and generally a variety of tops that go in at the waist the blazers and jackets with tapered waists are already present so we can expect the shirts to not lag too far behind
 
 





 
the pants
 
 





 
some examples
 
 





pants 1
 





 
pants 2
 
 




pants 3
 
 





pants 4 
 
 





pants 5
 
 





pants 6
 
 




pants 7 
 




 
pants 8 
 
 





pants 9
 
 





pants 10
 




 
slacks
 
 
 


 
the current standard cut for a pair of office slacks including suits is a highwaisted straight leg or wide leg pair of pants usually full length cropped ankle length pants are still encountered but usually in culotte or wide styles less so skinny pants the highwaisted cigarette pants or carrot leg or peg leg are still out there but the style is meant to be a little roomier in the butt and thighs the office is not the place for your tightest pair of pants these often come in a paperbag waist style which is very flattering on a lot of body types as well as comfortable  because the belt is adjustable 
 
 




 
the rise is getting lower however as low rise is coming back into fashion meaning that you should be able to find midrise and lowrise pants in wide cuts if that s what you ve been waiting for that won t change much for footwear but it might trigger some changes in terms of tops depending on what styles you re wearing now if you were used to tucking shirts into high waisted pants a low waist doesn t allow for that so you probably need to rethink and restrategize towards a top that sits untucked at the top of the hips for the most traditionally harmonious proportions 
 
 





 
nowadays a lot of pants have elasticated back waistbands or even entirely elasticated waists or drawstring waists office joggers exist for the new iteration of the more casual and relaxed postpandemic office rises and cuts are encountered in generous varieties there is no reason for a standard pair of slacks to be uncomfortable and god are there office pants of all varieties right now 
 
 




 
a quick note on fit 
 




 
even without stretch a pair of pants that fits well should not be uncomfortable should not pinch you anywhere dig into your stomach or feel tight or constricting size up go for a straight or wide leg if a tight leg is constricting and try a higher or lower rise if your waistband cuts into your stomach do not purchase the smallest size you can fit into bosquerella did an excellent writeup on the matter you can revisit if you need the reminder everyone deserves pants that fit 
 
 





 
whatever type of rise you re searching for i recommend measuring your ideal rise from between the legs and up to where you want it to hit whether that s 11 inches 14 inches 8 inches etc take a tape measure shopping if you have to measure the pants you re interested in or learn to eyeball it the name of the style doesn t necessarily tell you anything about how they re going to fit on you because all our bodies are different depending on the length of your torso you may need a different rise than the model does shop for your body
 
 
 




stretchy pants
 
 




 
leggings have never exactly been business casual and regardless of their debatable status they re just not current anymore leggings just don t read as polished when paired with business casual clothes and they require a high level of effort in every other aspect of the outfit in order to elevate them and make them presentable and current in the workplace 
 
 




 
the exception to this is an athleisure look in a workplace that is very casual and allows sportswear think tech or non clientfacing roles in other industries and speaking of leggings let s address their ugly stepsister ponte pants despite their misleading name they do not look like pants let s be honest 
 
 




 
if stretchy pants are your goto the much better  and more modern  option is a pair of straight leg athletic fabric pants straight leg or flared usually with a front seam or crease and even equipped with pockets this version at least attempts to mimic the look of regular pants 
 




 
 
the heels
 
 





 
some examples
 
 



 
heels 1
 
 
 



 
heels 2
 
 




 
heels 3
 
 
 




heels 4
 





 
 
while there are still plenty of industries and offices where heels are common or even explicitly required they are becoming less and less expected the current heel has changed both in height and in shapethickness thicker block heels are more current than stilettos a patent square mid heel will serve you well 
 
 



 
heeled maryjanes are currently the it shoe and there are variations on the strappy mid heel style at many different price points usually patent  but also leather for easier maintenance or satin for the highmaintenance dressers  mary janes are comfortable versatile inoffensive and come in many different colors at the moment sole thickness differs as does shape but a lot of them follow the rounded square shape that is currently popular in footwear 
 
 




 
boots haven t gone anywhere either a block heel ankle or knee high boot can be perfectly appropriate for the office as long as the heel isn t too high and they re not a very irreverent design 
 
 




 
the flats
 
 
 
 
some examples
 
 





flats1
 
 





flats2 
 
 





flats3
 




 
flats4

 




 
flats5
 
 





flats6
 
 




flats7
 
 





flats8
 
 





flats9
 





 
flats10
 
 






there seems to be a disconnect in mentality where a lot of people think that  trendy  shoes can t be comfortable dressing for comfort doesn t mean you need to wear basic shoes i m about to say something that i know is upsetting for like 70 of this sub but it needs to be said rothys are not a modern shoe 
 






 
more supportive shoes are in style thankfully and a loafer is much more current and better for your feet the guccitype loafer and the trend it sparked is a little more basic and doesn t stand out as much it s less of a statement and more of a supporting character in an outfit the platform loafers like the prada ones for example are trendier but they re also very comfortable the thicker sole is very supportive and provides good shock absorption if you re going to be walking miles in them 
 
 




 
if you want to retain the ballet flat style the modern ballet flat has a flatter square shape and danceinspired detailing that is meant to mimic actual ballet shoes pointed toe shoes are also coming back in fashion and the most modern iteration of a pointed ballet flat is a slingback 
 
 
 



maryjanes also have a strong presence among flat shoe styles one two or multistrap in patent leather or canvas for summer maryjanes are the perfect feminine but sophisticated shoe that can work with a variety of outfits including pants and skirts of varying lengths 
 
 




 
the bag
 
 




 
some examples
 






bag1  
 
 





bag2
 
 





bag3 
 
 





bag4
 
 






 
bags for the office can be tricky because they oftentimes have to carry your whole life but still remain professionallooking that s one of the reasons why huge unstructured bags like the lv neverfull and the longchamp le pliage were popular for so long  they re not cute but they re practical 
 
 



 
thankfully something even better came along and that is the bizcas backpack carrying a laptop your lunch your water bottle your umbrella and your gym shoes on your shoulder is a oneway ticket to a messed up posture health problems and an expensive chiropractor bill choose comfort practicality and fashion by opting for a modern backpack instead of a gaping nylon bag with thin straps that dig into your shoulder 
 
 



 
leather is the most elevated choice but leather backpacks can be heavy depending on size and construction so take your time assessing the best material for your needs

if you re in a more formal industry that still expects a suit the best thing you can do for your work wardrobe is to get yourself a colorful one suiting is huge right now  and has been for a few years  so there is no shortage of officeappropriate options that won t bore you to death valentino pink is particularly prevalent as it s one of the hot colors of the season but bottega green is also in and you can find an entire range of power colors to give you that extra pop 
 
 



 
if you d rather play it more subdued there are plenty of pastel options to choose from softer more feminine but still 100 professional pastel suits allow you to cheer up your office wardrobe particularly for the spring and summer seasons as these tend to come in summerweight fabrics 
 
 




 
the interesting top

top6
 
 





 top7
 
 
 


 
if you want a look that s more elevated but still retains the same basic neutral top  neutral bottoms formula all you have to do is tweak the style of the shirt you can still keep it white or another neutral shade but make sure there s an interesting design to it you can play with shape  oversized billowy straight cropped voluminous etc  it s up to you and your preferences design details  voluminous sleeves interesting neckline details contrasting trims or buttons etc material  silk linen satin very current which also impact drape and silhouette 
 
 
 



again color is not something you need to shy away from in the workplace especially if you re going to pair it with neutrals there is nothing about colorful clothes that is inherently unprofessional unless you work at a funeral home if a top is professional in white it s also professional in blue or magenta a  spicy  shirt can be the visual interest you need in an otherwise drab work outfit 
 
 


 
the midi skirt

you may have noticed that in recent years the skirtdress length has been the midi reaching around mid calf the midi oftentimes has a medium to long leg slit but there are simpler and less sexy versions for the office the shape is straight or conical rather than the aline accordion pleated midis we saw around 2016 however it s not the tight pencil skirt shape of the 2010s either think more bodyskimming rather than a spandexy bodycon 
 
 
 




in addition to being very current the midi is very officefriendly because of the conservative length it goes great with heels but it also looks good with flats especially the more modern chunky shoes a midi skirt can be worn with a classic buttonup shirt or a thin turtleneck a chunky knit a tshirt for more casual offices and it can even be taken out for drinks or shopping after work or on the weekend a very versatile piece that can work hard in your wardrobe for the next few years 
 
 




 
the danger with a long skirt is to not veer into frumpy churchy territory if you re going for a midi look i recommend styling it in a very intentional way with some very modern accessories a midi skirt with a thinsoled ballet shoe from 2012 and a long thin cardigan might look frumpy and awkward but a midi with a chunky loafer and an oversized blazer looks like an intentional outfit same with boots  forego the heeled low cut ankle boot and instead opt for a chunky kneehigh boot it can also look very chic with a longer oversized chunky knit
 
 




 
another way to make sure it s not reading frumpy is to pick a modern fabric leather skirts are very in right now as are satin slipstyle skirts in the right cut and in a highquality material they can be professional while still remaining stylish

the main aspect people appreciate about wearing sneakers is that they are comfortable but if you re looking to update your work wardrobe you should know that allbirdsstyle shoes are an outdated style a black pair could be somewhat neutral especially combined with a chic modern allblack outfit 
 
 
 



but there are equally comfortable sneakers out there that are sleeker more modern and more professional you don t have to wear the chunky dad sneakers your 15 yearold is wearing but a sleek white sneaker with a clean shape that s not overly stylized or embellished is a perfectly respectable choice that will bring your work style closer to 2023 no synthetic mesh please
 
 



 
if you feel like white is too stark and stands out too much as an athletic shoe black is always a safe choice if you can afford to be really daring in a casual office you can even try a pair of platform converse they re not just more current but they re also much more comfortable because the sole isn t as thin and lacking in support as the classic version plus you get a tiny bit of height even without heels 
 
 
 



the jeans
 
 


 
some examples
 





jeans1 
 
 
 



jeans2
 
 




 
jeans3

jeans5
 
 



 
 
jeans in the workplace were once a hotly debated matter and it may still depend entirely on your specific office but in a postcovid world where so many are reluctant to even go back to the office at all dress codes have relaxed and jeans are more prevalent than ever before and why shouldn t they be a good rule of thumb for wearing jeans in the office is to stick to a pair that is nondistressed and solidcolored no rips stone washing or fading and whiskering black dark blue or midblue are all okay colors maybe even white in the summer 
 
 



 
for an updated outfit the new styles of jeans are all very workplacefriendly because they don t cling to the body so tightly like skinny jeans did so they re not emphasizing anything that an old white man might be offended by or overly taken by there is no reason why a pair of straight leg or wide leg jeans shouldn t pair great with a shirt a sweater a blazer and a pair of loafers for a casual office environment i d stick to jeans that are actually hemmed and not distressed but at the same time your legs are mostly under a desk so only you know what you can get away with
 
 



 
modernize your office fit
 
 



 
finally let s look at some typical average office fits you d see 10 years ago and how we can retain the same basic reliable structure but with updated pieces allow me to remind you that we don t need to throw out the clothes in the outdated examples and replace them all with clothes from the updated ones you can get more mileage out of your clothes if you mix and match with some more modern pieces 
 
 



 
sweater  black pants





 
do this
 
 







instead of this
 




 
 
the cut matters so much in an outfit as you can see in these examples we re still retaining the exact same formula but we re simply updating the pieces while it s still a big oversized gray sweater the style becomes chunkier with balloon sleeves 
 
 




the black pants are flared instead of skinny which is a more modern cut the boots aren t almondtoe but pointed and they match the other lightcolored accessories 
 






 long topsweater  leggings  flats

 




do this
 
 
 





instead of this
 
 






if your office is casual enough you may still be able to get away with wearing leggings rather than pairing them with ballet flats opt for a pair of sleek sneakers you can still keep the white shirt and the knit format but update to a chunky knit sweater instead of the thin cardigan accessorizing with a big scarf indoors is unnecessary unless it s cold if you want to keep the accent scarf opt for a thinner silk square scarf instead 
 







top  cardigan  slacks




 
do this
 
 




 
instead of this
 




 
this is a great example of how you can still wear your long cardigans in a much more modern fit if you look at the first example that short tight cardigan on top of a tight top makes it look like the cardigan doesn t fit her properly it s straining on her body that s never a flattering fit the looser cardigan with a more generous cut in the second example allows for a more comfortable fit 
 




 
the belt is present in both examples for waist emphasis but tucking the top inside the pants rather than letting it hang on top is an instant update you can easily make to your everyday fit if you prefer an untucked top that s perfectly fine but choose a looser fit and not a tight jersey top 
 
 




accessories also irrevocably date an outfit the chunky statement jewelry can easily be swapped for simpler pieces that subtly enhance and highlight rather than being the focus of your overall fit 
 
 
 



sweater  jeans





 
do this
 
 




 
instead of this
 
 







if you re gonna do a knit with jeans for work you can easily update the look swap the skinnies for a pair of straight leg jeans the riding boots or ankle boots can be changed into combat boots or a chunky pair of oxfords and the knit can be swapped for a chunkier either cropped or oversized sweater or you can opt for an oversized knit vest it s worn over a tshirt in this example but it works beautifully over a longsleeved buttonup shirt or even over a tight turtleneck 
 




 
dark suit  heels








do this
 
 




or this
 





 
instead of this
 
 





 
the basic suit has changed shape with slim ankle pants being less current than straight long pants with a crease the blazer is longer less fitted and more oversized and the heels have more of a square toe or a more elongated point rather than the short pointed heel in the first example 
 
 




white shirt  jeans  flats



 
do this
 
 
 




instead of this
 





 
as you can see sometimes it s just a matter of styling the two examples aren t that different just slightly updated the jeans are no longer skinny but straightcut it s still a style that conforms to your shape just more modern and less constricting the shirt is tucked into the jeans instead of a long untucked shirt we still keep flat shoes but we choose something with a platform 
 
 





again opting for minimal jewelry over the chunky statement necklaces will instantly make your otufit feel fresher and more modern

femalefashionadvice,allbirds,My Wide Foot Manifesto (With Recs!),"I'm posting this on a few commented suggestions from my previous post on Rothy's Dupes.

&#x200B;

I'm a 5 foot 4 inches woman, 140 lbs, with a larger bust. I'm also, not ""ideally shaped"". Meaning I am familiar with the constant search for the ""short"" length, the slim ""petite"" selections, and the white whale ""wide width"" shoe. As a result, I am *constantly* shopping for clothes that actually fit. Yes, it's fun, but finding something that truly fits has been an uphill battle since day zero (I'm a programmer, [we start arrays at zero](https://xkcd.com/163/)!). So, me and my pizza shaped feet have been On. A. Mission. To find the ideal wide shoe. (*Spoiler*: The ideal shoe [were the friends we found along the way](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72F0Bvsi8CLuY5KE/giphy.gif)).

Okay, here are the things to know:

# The Bad Wide Shoe Traits

Here are things I've experienced with wide shoes that, well, suck. Some of these also apply to our Narrow sisters as well!

1. **Fewer Options (color/styles)**
   1. Wide shoes aren't typically made in all the colors and models for each shoe. Simply because we're not the ""key demographic"" according to the makers, and try to cover us while making a decent overhead. It is annoying because I cannot buy a pair of red shoes without significant effort. A person who isn't can't do that.
   2. [Exhibit A](https://imgur.com/vnasrmE): ""Pumps Women"" unfiltered search on DSW
      1. This is a set of sexy stilettos. The SEO here is like, ""oh yeah, firey hot red sexy lady party, rock on. Go out on the town, go the clubs. Party. Meet a sexy person, be sexy, take a sexy selfie, oh, ah, oh ah, only at mattress giant. This is great, want it in red? GET IT IN RED YOU SEXY PERSON YOU. YES. FIERCE, [BLUE STEEL](https://media.giphy.com/media/X9RBixlR36Uco/giphy.gif), VOGUE, GO GO YES, INTO THE CAMERA, MAKE LOVE TO THE CAMERA.""
   3. [Exhibit B](https://imgur.com/tklIq6N): Filtered to Wide
      1. This set of shoes is reserved for the shaded area of a Venn diagram consisting of matronly knitting, and [community](https://media.giphy.com/media/gQsfOW387X9Hq/giphy.gif) college business course photos with just the right amount of diverse representation.
2. **Settling for Floppy/Hurtful Shoes**
   1. The shoes I've gotten ""close enough"" to fitting, flop a lot on the end of it. What happens is I buy a shoe that fits at the ball of my foot, so it ""stays"". However, when I step up, the back of the heel flops. However, I am at a corporate job so I *need* a pair of black heels, and I have a meeting on Monday morning. So you end up buying the pair of shoes, and basically powering through until they're ""broken in"" or you throw them out. This is doubly terrible for heels because you will fall on your bum!
3. **They're Expensive**
   1. Typically they're not only tougher to find, but more expensive. As with any specialty sizing, like petite sizing, they cost more. The brands serve a smaller market, and so they try to either make their money back (or understand we're willing to pay) by asking for more. In addition, if there is a shoe you *really* love, you try to make it work by stretching or adding pads. This also are more costs and time for one pair of shoes.
   2. Note: I, for one am VERY WILLING to shell out cash for great shoes that fit. I just.. haven't found any!
4. **They're Only Online**
   1. Like any specialty sizing, they're typically more options only online. That means it's a gamble when you order if it *actually* fits. You usually have to order two, only to find both don't work (figures!). Then you have to do the return dance which sucks.
5. **Foot Condoms**
   1. Okay, this is a major pet peeve for me. Most, if not all women, own what I refer to as a ""foot condom"". These are those weirdo [scrunchy shoes](https://www.amazon.com/Ollio-Womens-Shoes-Comfort-Ballet/dp/B07978X8NM/ref=cts_sh_3_vtp) that leaves nothing to the imagination, and arch up when not worn.
      1. What are they? They are little tiny wisps of fabric that are glued to your foot like a trash bag was vacuumed around your big ass toes. Nothing is left to the imagination. No your toe cleavage may not be showing, but the other feet sure as hell knows when your feet are in a cold space or feelin' frisky (watch out for foot matching dances). They also have the shoe thickness of those slices of tomato they show on the home shopping network where they're selling high quality Japanese knives for 80 easy payments of 4 cents and need to read the newspaper through a fruit. You have no protections against mini potholes, Arctic conference rooms, or [upcoming corporate singularity with these shoes](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IylOPCNkiqOgMyA/giphy.gif). However, they *are* perfect for your upcoming costume part in Bath for Jane Austen day, and look! They have a cute little bow that will annoy and bounce. How [quaint](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JdZUPzYZ3cL1fFK/giphy.gif)!
      2. I hate them, BUT I end up owning 14 pairs. Why? They are the best fit for the weirdest feet. As a result, even though I think they're kind of ugly and don't work, and *I need some goddess damn black flats for* [work](https://media.giphy.com/media/w3RhszxPfflAs/giphy.gif) you settle for them.
6. **Harder to ""tailor"" shoes**
   1. While in some cases it may work, it is much harder to tailor a shoe versus a piece of clothing. As a [short](https://reductress.com/post/man-love-tiny-woman-because-she-make-feel-big/) person, I can tailor my skirts or my shirts. But, getting my shoes widened, and shortened is much harder to get done. I usually have to find a shoe hospital, or similar. It's easier to find a local dry cleaner that tailors than a shoe place.

# Know your official size, and if you're wide

The easiest way is to get out a ruler and put your foot on it (many prefer to draw around your foot on a paper on the ground then compare that). Then go to [this site](http://www.sizecharter.com/clothing-fit-and-measurement/understanding-shoe-sizing) and check your length, and your width. I am the length of a US 7, and the width of a 7.5 W. So I'm too short and wide. Considering my [hot slice of a pizza](https://media.giphy.com/media/6EncNPTYts8lq/giphy.gif) body, this matches. However, most of my shoes are closer to 7 or 7.5 as I often find it's easier to stretch a shoe then shorten it.

# What ""other things"" can I do to make my shoes fit better?

There are a few things to expand your options. Sadly, all of them require you to spend more cash. But, here ya go:

* **Get a** [**Shoe Stretcher**](https://www.amazon.com/Eachway-Professional-Premium-Stretcher-Adjustable/dp/B01NAKQEBL/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=shoe+stretcher&qid=1564278621&s=gateway&sr=8-3)
   * I stretch all my shoes for 24 hr (per shoe) before I buy. As I have a more short than wide foot, I end up buying a size down and trying to stretch it.
* **Buy Ankle** [**Pads**](https://www.amazon.com/Heel-Cushion-Inserts-Prevention-Protectors/dp/B07GXHT6GR/ref=sr_1_23?keywords=shoe+pads&qid=1564278732&s=gateway&sr=8-23)
   * If you buy a shoe that fits your width, but *not* your ankle, you usually get a lot of ""flops"". You can add pads that sit inside the ankle. However these I typically have issues with. I end up having a large gap between where my ankle top hits the pad, and the bottom half doesn't. That leaves room for slipping around if I go in funny angles (which is... [often](https://media.giphy.com/media/TfKfqjt2i4GIM/giphy.gif).)
* **Get your shoe adjusted**
   * You'd have to find a place in town that does this. It's very hit or miss per city, and typically costs over $50. I wouldn't recommend this for the average shoe. I did find an [online place](https://www.myshoehospital.com/), but I haven't tried it.

Frankly... these are about it. If your shoe doesn't fit, it's either this o[r live with it.](https://media.giphy.com/media/oFI7FttD0iC8V2Iqmy/giphy.gif)

# Shoe Features to Avoid In Standard Sizing

&#x200B;

* **Strict mid ball straps** ([Example](https://www.amazon.com/MVE-Shoes-Womens-Single-Joana-1/dp/B07V3NMK58/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=strap+heels&qid=1564280919&s=gateway&sr=8-5))
   * This is very hit or miss. If there is a strap right across the ball of the foot, it might be the perfect width if you size up, but that only works if you got a *very* adjustable ankle strap. If you do, it works out nicely since you just size up and adjust that. If you don't, then you end up just rubbing up against it like a [dog in heat](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/190/cover.jpg).
* **Peep Toe**
   * Usually I never have the right foot to length ratio to make my foot cleavage make all the foot boys come to my foot yard.
* **Mules**
   * These are shoes that are ""covered"" in the front half but not the back. They just never really work. What ends up happening is a flip flop, but it hits your heel with the intensity of more cowbell. It isn't worth the loud [slapping](https://media.giphy.com/media/1zgOyLCRxCmV5G3GFZ/giphy.gif).
* **Canvases with no stretch**
   * Sometimes this is fine, but if you're wide you typically search for the stretchiest shoe material (See my foot condom rant) for a reason. The downside of it stretching to fit you is that the foot will spill over the sides or front, leaving it unprotected from the ground. This can lead to back issues. See Naomi Small's [season 8 entrance look](https://external-preview.redd.it/7bgA1Bn27pwwWiRU6L6XwSQ94O210ZwFH7BV61W-70o.jpg?width=1200&height=628.272251309&auto=webp&s=7a54909628fe451100056e1ca699eb61e01f64ac).

&#x200B;

# Signs a Shoe May Work Out!

* **A very adjustable ankle strap, or elastic back.** Lets you have a wide front but will fit your ""narrower"" to width ratio ankle
   * [Example](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-day-heel-brightred?collection=womens-heels)
* **Stretcher Canvas.** Like I said before, this does lead to a spill over, but this might work if the shoe sole bottom is wide enough. This is why knit flats are so popular.
   * [Example](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/skechers-cleo-flat/420522?activeColor=017&rrec=true)
* **If it... comes is a wide size!**! Okay, this one is a given
* **Not a stiff pointed toe.** This one sucks to write because I'm basically saying that a certain style won't be in your wheel house, and I love this type. However, what happens is the pointed toe goes from wide to point too quickly, and you end up either a) having a real awkward bulge in your shoe, that you may need to cover with a [binder in middle school](https://media.giphy.com/media/14dXclYKbx2ONW/giphy.gif), or b) it pinches and hurts.
* **Lots of Non Ankle Straps.** My favorite shoes tend to be ones that ""hold"" my foot in place, and straps that work across your foot, that are not in the ball part of your foot, work out really well usually. Especially if they hold across your arch.

# The Ones I've Tried.. And Probably Won't Re-buy

Now remember, just because I tried these on and had these reactions, *doesn't mean they won't work for you*. Ever person is different, and these might be the greatest shoe for you. If so, great!! But, I want to be honest in my reactions and these were ones that weren't enough for me.

* [Tieks](https://tieks.com/cobalt.html) ($175)
   * The most expensive foot condom out there! I got cobalt, but it actually is closer to a corn flower blue. Here were my opinions.
   * Pros:
      * I *loved* the bottom teal soles. And I mean they are teal. Like, sixty-year-old-aunt-who-just-loves-going-to-brunch-in-bejeweled-sandals-and-has-these-capris-in-this-color-that-just-screams-""oh, fun!"" teal. These things are Tom Hardy hardy. Nothing can get through them. I mean, when the teenage dystopian future comes, and I need something pure and tough to protect me from my Roomba Feline overlord while having a PG-13 level romantic moment with a guy with the perfect 90s [mcdonalds logo](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-05/enhanced/webdr08/23/15/original-grid-image-28196-1400875025-6.jpg?crop=588:882;19,0&downsize=400:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto) shaped hair bangs, I'm heading straight to the Tieks warehouses. I will wear my teal plated armor with pride as [I ride into battle](https://media.giphy.com/media/6901DbEbbm4o0/giphy.gif).
      * Great returns policy!
   * Cons:
      * I got an 8, they were too way too long. So I had to return, got a 7, but I could tell it's too small as my feel spill out on the side a bit. They don't do half sizes :(.
      * The inner sole is a very smooth leather. I could complain about how it quickly [tinted from sweat](https://crazytogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tieks-24-1024x684.jpg) (link to photo I found), but I have a Much Bigger Issue to bring up. You know when you wear new shoes, and you're feeling just plain sassy. I mean just feeling your stuff as your round the cubicle corner, your executive partner of your firm will walk by, and you'll realize your shoes are squeaking out a fart noise with *every single step* as your heel moves on the leather. That's right, I had to make strong eye contact to a[ssert my corporate dominance](https://media.giphy.com/media/52FcaTVc9Y1rk7q1NQ/giphy.gif) with the patriarchy while making foot fart noises. I've owned them for 6 months... and they're still fartin'.
      * The leather that is the canvas of the shoe is a bit thicker and stronger than the usual foot condoms. While I actually like a lot of that at first, it does show that they are using better materials, I had a few issue with it I didn't expect. Mostly, that because the elastic tension was stronger, it pinched my big toe down non stop. As a result, I can only wear these for about 5 hours. After words it feels like I've put a pair of [pliers](https://media.giphy.com/media/kAhYjZZlSCLRu/giphy.gif) on my giant toe nail and took an hour to undo out of the shoes. I've shoe stretched them 3 times, and still have this problem. I found a photo that shows what I mean.

   * Another internet favorite. I got a size 8. I really wanted to like these.
   * Pros:
      * These actually fit pretty well for the ball of my foot. I had a little spill on the side, but a lot less than usual. It did feel ""long"" but I expected that for the pointed toe.
      * The shoe sole was really strong here too.
      * Really soft!
      * I love, love, love the eco factor here. It was one of the main reasons I bought them.
   * Cons:
      * They shrank. It was *100% my fault*! They tout being washer friendly, however they are cold water *only*. They also cannot be put into the dryer. They absolutely shrink and cannot be stretched back out again. The reason why I put this in the con bucket, even though it was my fault, is that I live in a very, very hot part of the US. Heat is a natural part of life in Texas, so if I leave these in the car they can potentially heat up and shrink. I need shoes that can handle [90\*F](https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGppLes0ENI5osCc/giphy.gif) \+.
      * They *stank*. I have never, ever had a pair of shoes smell on me. These were the very first. Now, I know many would claim I should wash the soles, or buy new ones, but the smell was noticeable after only 3 wears. The only fix would be for me to buy a cloth sole, or similar. I'm willing to do that, but not from their soles. I don't know of any cloth pointed toe ones I would buy that would fit rothy's pointed toe specifically without causing more friction of my already tight foot. Now, could I find a ""sorta"" fit? Sure, but these are already shoes I ""sorta"" fit into. It feels like a sunk cost.
* Cheap Pointed Strappy Flats on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KTC4S4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($20)
   * I've bought a number of these types online. They usually *start* well. However, every pointed leather toe I've gotten gets dented and flakes color. And, the sole isn't very supportive.
* [Dr. Scholl's Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/dr.-scholls-leader-flat/418042?activeColor=005)
   * I cannot tell you what it is about this brand, and I have gone back lots and lots of time like a booty call, but I just cannot make it work. My problem almost every time, wide or regular width, is that the inner curve of the shoe that hits my skin will always ([always](https://media.giphy.com/media/10osILvZ4ez7ws/giphy.gif)!) pinch and leave a half moon shape of red on my skin. It seems like since they're all about comfort it would work, but it just hurts that and my toe box a lot.
   * In addition, you can see the blue interior? It's actually not that much memory foam feeling. It feels kind of hard honestly.
* [Katie and Kate Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/kelly-and-katie-pirassa-ballet-flat/398237?activeColor=840&rrec=true)
   * These have the issue of they fit really well in the store... but not after an hour when my foot swells. They fool me every time!! However, I bet narrow folks would love these really tough canvas shoes.

# Shoes I Will Buy Again:

My most bought often shoes are flats and pumps. However, I included a few others here that I liked:

* **Naturalizer** (My Gold Standard)
   * These guys are *great*. They clearly make their shoe length shorter than others, so it makes it very easy for me to buy them. I've only found one where I actually had to buy wide (their pointed toe flat). I flux between 7 and 7.5. Note I *didn't* say wide! That means it's easier for me to find in store and try on since they typically have a close enough fit.
   * Here are the ones I own:
      * [Wedge Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-hydie-wedge-pump/409290?activeColor=200) in 7.5 - (I was able to play tug on hardwood in these with my 70lb dog!)
      * [Dalee Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-dalee-pump/465864?activeColor=251)  in 7 - (I own white)
      * [Brown Wide Calf Boot](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-kelso-wide-calf-riding-boot/461558?activeColor=204) in 7 W (I have an older version)
      * [Open Strap Sandals](https://www.amazon.com/Naturalizer-Womens-Fabric-Strappy-Sandals/dp/B071XPX2YG/ref=sr_1_16?crid=1724PUKPK2Z23&keywords=naturalizer+velcro+sandals+for+women&qid=1564330866&s=gateway&sprefix=naturalizer+velcro%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-16) in 7.5 (Don't let the Velcro strap fool you, these are a god send)
* **Ann Klein** **Sport** (Favorite for Work)
   * These guys are great for anything I need for work. They usually have a lot of elastic without it being obvious. I continual go to them for my standards. Right now I own:
      * [Black Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/anne-klein-sport-oalise-flat/446556?activeColor=960) in 7
* **Sketcher's Bobs** (Slip On)
   * WE STAN MEMORY FOAM. And they donate to charities based on the designs. My favorite are the puppy ones. I own:
      * [Black Heather](https://www.amazon.com/Skechers-Womens-Plush-33910-Black-Heather/dp/B00PRA6TSA/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=sketchers+bobs&qid=1564331066&s=gateway&sr=8-2) in 7.5
* **Addias Cloud Foam Sneakers** (Fashion Sneaker)
   * Run, don't walk, to [these](https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Womens-Cloudfoam-Advantage-Sneakers/dp/B01HSIRMSE/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=adidas+women+sneakers&qid=1564282094&s=gateway&sr=8-9). These are the best. Got them at nordstrom rack for a steal. I've worn them overseas and back, and they're [GREAT](https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IvnJQAy7SGlcR2/giphy.gif).
* **Lucky Brand Ellie Flat** (Budget Buy)
   * This is borderline tiek-like, but It isn't too much that it creates that ""C"" when not worn. It doesn't have the thickest bottom, but they fit really well for what price point they come at. And the leather is really easy to stretch with a shoe stretcher.
      * [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Brand-Womens-American-Leather/dp/B00HRVXKWU/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ellie+flat&qid=1564317512&s=gateway&sr=8-2) in 7.5
* **Booties & Boots**
   * I love talking about these because my husband gets mad and thinks I mean the baby shoes (lol). No, but seriously shoes that are boots are basically a god send for wide shoe people. They're basically sneaker fits but with more professional fit. Here are ones I like:
      * [Riverberry](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010QWX1ZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (These are lasting! Great for the price)
      * [MVE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GJYYLYY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (These have a real hearty heel, almost like a cowboy boot)
      * Target has a few great ones too
* **ModCloth T Strap Flat**
   * These have a *great* wide width, but I still had the 'pointed toe dent' issue. However, in all other ways these excel. I got a blue set with flowers on it that are a compliment magnet.
   * [Link](https://www.modcloth.com/shop/shoes/modcloth-turn-back-prime-t-strap-flat-in-navy-floral/165008.html) in 7W
* **A\*\*\*\*rbella**
   * I got some at DSW, and they're definitely the ""wear all day at work"" pair of heels. Super comfortable, but is a kitten heel. They aren't sexy, but they work! There is also a clear knit/stretch to the fabric so it's great for me. Overall though, their inner sole is really great to stand on, and they have a few other fun colors. I got away with not going W for my size
   * [Judith Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/abella-judith-pump/349651?activeColor=001)
* [Clarks](https://www.amazon.com/CLARKS-Womens-Adriel-Viola-Leather/dp/B01N5CWLR4/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=clarks&qid=1564281229&s=gateway&sr=8-15) & [Life Stride](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/2595472011?_encoding=UTF8&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=LifeStride&ref_=w_bl_sl_ap_sh_web_2595472011)
   * I have a few heels from both of them , and they're great for the standard day to day. I'm not excited personally on their other styles, but if you need a nude heel that works, these get the job done. I found life stride though does tend to pinch after a while on the area near the arch to the top of the shoe. But I suspect I need to size up or stretch more.
   * I own:
      * [LifeStride Seemless Dress Pump (7.5W)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0117ZX5C6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Me Too](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/me-too-pacific-loafer/459726?activeColor=543)
   * These definitely can have the corporate grandma feel if you let them, but every now and then they pop out some really nice stuff. Great support inside the heel.
* [COM & SENS](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-pomaro-pump/400535?activeColor=061) (And [another](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-brunna-sandal/429890?activeColor=002), and [another](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-missy-wedge-sandal/450318?activeColor=200)) is my new up and comer
   * They tend to have a lot of ""elastic"" elements that aren't the shoe itself. It's really great for the stretch without the shoe spill over issue. Now, their look isn't for all, as it's typically obvious it's a comfort shoe, but who cares? Do what you [wanttttt](https://media.giphy.com/media/jL0c2TrfDUz9S/giphy.gif). They also always have great arch support.

# The Shoes I'm Eyeing But Haven't Bought

* More Naturalizer (*ALWAYS*)
   * I want a blush pink flat or similar, so I'm eyeing their site.
* [CINAK Flats](https://www.amazon.com/CINAK-Women-Flats-Shoes-Slip/dp/B07DZZ7G7G/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=comfort+flats&qid=1564282006&s=gateway&sr=8-10) (Budget Pick)
* [Antonia Saint](https://www.antoniasaintny.com/)
   * Their ads are all about how it's a heel that feels like a sneaker. Very curious
* [AllBirds](https://www.allbirds.com/)
* [Arbella Quanta Flat](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/abella-quanta-flat/457185?activeColor=001)

Last Updated: 10/27/2019

&#x200B;

Got some recs? Please share and I'll post them here!",1564402480.0,"My Wide Foot Manifesto (With Recs!) I'm posting this on a few commented suggestions from my previous post on Rothy's Dupes.

&#x200B;

I'm a 5 foot 4 inches woman, 140 lbs, with a larger bust. I'm also, not ""ideally shaped"". Meaning I am familiar with the constant search for the ""short"" length, the slim ""petite"" selections, and the white whale ""wide width"" shoe. As a result, I am *constantly* shopping for clothes that actually fit. Yes, it's fun, but finding something that truly fits has been an uphill battle since day zero (I'm a programmer, [we start arrays at zero](https://xkcd.com/163/)!). So, me and my pizza shaped feet have been On. A. Mission. To find the ideal wide shoe. (*Spoiler*: The ideal shoe [were the friends we found along the way](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72F0Bvsi8CLuY5KE/giphy.gif)).

Okay, here are the things to know:

# The Bad Wide Shoe Traits

Here are things I've experienced with wide shoes that, well, suck. Some of these also apply to our Narrow sisters as well!

1. **Fewer Options (color/styles)**
   1. Wide shoes aren't typically made in all the colors and models for each shoe. Simply because we're not the ""key demographic"" according to the makers, and try to cover us while making a decent overhead. It is annoying because I cannot buy a pair of red shoes without significant effort. A person who isn't can't do that.
   2. [Exhibit A](https://imgur.com/vnasrmE): ""Pumps Women"" unfiltered search on DSW
      1. This is a set of sexy stilettos. The SEO here is like, ""oh yeah, firey hot red sexy lady party, rock on. Go out on the town, go the clubs. Party. Meet a sexy person, be sexy, take a sexy selfie, oh, ah, oh ah, only at mattress giant. This is great, want it in red? GET IT IN RED YOU SEXY PERSON YOU. YES. FIERCE, [BLUE STEEL](https://media.giphy.com/media/X9RBixlR36Uco/giphy.gif), VOGUE, GO GO YES, INTO THE CAMERA, MAKE LOVE TO THE CAMERA.""
   3. [Exhibit B](https://imgur.com/tklIq6N): Filtered to Wide
      1. This set of shoes is reserved for the shaded area of a Venn diagram consisting of matronly knitting, and [community](https://media.giphy.com/media/gQsfOW387X9Hq/giphy.gif) college business course photos with just the right amount of diverse representation.
2. **Settling for Floppy/Hurtful Shoes**
   1. The shoes I've gotten ""close enough"" to fitting, flop a lot on the end of it. What happens is I buy a shoe that fits at the ball of my foot, so it ""stays"". However, when I step up, the back of the heel flops. However, I am at a corporate job so I *need* a pair of black heels, and I have a meeting on Monday morning. So you end up buying the pair of shoes, and basically powering through until they're ""broken in"" or you throw them out. This is doubly terrible for heels because you will fall on your bum!
3. **They're Expensive**
   1. Typically they're not only tougher to find, but more expensive. As with any specialty sizing, like petite sizing, they cost more. The brands serve a smaller market, and so they try to either make their money back (or understand we're willing to pay) by asking for more. In addition, if there is a shoe you *really* love, you try to make it work by stretching or adding pads. This also are more costs and time for one pair of shoes.
   2. Note: I, for one am VERY WILLING to shell out cash for great shoes that fit. I just.. haven't found any!
4. **They're Only Online**
   1. Like any specialty sizing, they're typically more options only online. That means it's a gamble when you order if it *actually* fits. You usually have to order two, only to find both don't work (figures!). Then you have to do the return dance which sucks.
5. **Foot Condoms**
   1. Okay, this is a major pet peeve for me. Most, if not all women, own what I refer to as a ""foot condom"". These are those weirdo [scrunchy shoes](https://www.amazon.com/Ollio-Womens-Shoes-Comfort-Ballet/dp/B07978X8NM/ref=cts_sh_3_vtp) that leaves nothing to the imagination, and arch up when not worn.
      1. What are they? They are little tiny wisps of fabric that are glued to your foot like a trash bag was vacuumed around your big ass toes. Nothing is left to the imagination. No your toe cleavage may not be showing, but the other feet sure as hell knows when your feet are in a cold space or feelin' frisky (watch out for foot matching dances). They also have the shoe thickness of those slices of tomato they show on the home shopping network where they're selling high quality Japanese knives for 80 easy payments of 4 cents and need to read the newspaper through a fruit. You have no protections against mini potholes, Arctic conference rooms, or [upcoming corporate singularity with these shoes](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IylOPCNkiqOgMyA/giphy.gif). However, they *are* perfect for your upcoming costume part in Bath for Jane Austen day, and look! They have a cute little bow that will annoy and bounce. How [quaint](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JdZUPzYZ3cL1fFK/giphy.gif)!
      2. I hate them, BUT I end up owning 14 pairs. Why? They are the best fit for the weirdest feet. As a result, even though I think they're kind of ugly and don't work, and *I need some goddess damn black flats for* [work](https://media.giphy.com/media/w3RhszxPfflAs/giphy.gif) you settle for them.
6. **Harder to ""tailor"" shoes**
   1. While in some cases it may work, it is much harder to tailor a shoe versus a piece of clothing. As a [short](https://reductress.com/post/man-love-tiny-woman-because-she-make-feel-big/) person, I can tailor my skirts or my shirts. But, getting my shoes widened, and shortened is much harder to get done. I usually have to find a shoe hospital, or similar. It's easier to find a local dry cleaner that tailors than a shoe place.

# Know your official size, and if you're wide

The easiest way is to get out a ruler and put your foot on it (many prefer to draw around your foot on a paper on the ground then compare that). Then go to [this site](http://www.sizecharter.com/clothing-fit-and-measurement/understanding-shoe-sizing) and check your length, and your width. I am the length of a US 7, and the width of a 7.5 W. So I'm too short and wide. Considering my [hot slice of a pizza](https://media.giphy.com/media/6EncNPTYts8lq/giphy.gif) body, this matches. However, most of my shoes are closer to 7 or 7.5 as I often find it's easier to stretch a shoe then shorten it.

# What ""other things"" can I do to make my shoes fit better?

There are a few things to expand your options. Sadly, all of them require you to spend more cash. But, here ya go:

* **Get a** [**Shoe Stretcher**](https://www.amazon.com/Eachway-Professional-Premium-Stretcher-Adjustable/dp/B01NAKQEBL/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=shoe+stretcher&qid=1564278621&s=gateway&sr=8-3)
   * I stretch all my shoes for 24 hr (per shoe) before I buy. As I have a more short than wide foot, I end up buying a size down and trying to stretch it.
* **Buy Ankle** [**Pads**](https://www.amazon.com/Heel-Cushion-Inserts-Prevention-Protectors/dp/B07GXHT6GR/ref=sr_1_23?keywords=shoe+pads&qid=1564278732&s=gateway&sr=8-23)
   * If you buy a shoe that fits your width, but *not* your ankle, you usually get a lot of ""flops"". You can add pads that sit inside the ankle. However these I typically have issues with. I end up having a large gap between where my ankle top hits the pad, and the bottom half doesn't. That leaves room for slipping around if I go in funny angles (which is... [often](https://media.giphy.com/media/TfKfqjt2i4GIM/giphy.gif).)
* **Get your shoe adjusted**
   * You'd have to find a place in town that does this. It's very hit or miss per city, and typically costs over $50. I wouldn't recommend this for the average shoe. I did find an [online place](https://www.myshoehospital.com/), but I haven't tried it.

Frankly... these are about it. If your shoe doesn't fit, it's either this o[r live with it.](https://media.giphy.com/media/oFI7FttD0iC8V2Iqmy/giphy.gif)

# Shoe Features to Avoid In Standard Sizing

&#x200B;

* **Strict mid ball straps** ([Example](https://www.amazon.com/MVE-Shoes-Womens-Single-Joana-1/dp/B07V3NMK58/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=strap+heels&qid=1564280919&s=gateway&sr=8-5))
   * This is very hit or miss. If there is a strap right across the ball of the foot, it might be the perfect width if you size up, but that only works if you got a *very* adjustable ankle strap. If you do, it works out nicely since you just size up and adjust that. If you don't, then you end up just rubbing up against it like a [dog in heat](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/190/cover.jpg).
* **Peep Toe**
   * Usually I never have the right foot to length ratio to make my foot cleavage make all the foot boys come to my foot yard.
* **Mules**
   * These are shoes that are ""covered"" in the front half but not the back. They just never really work. What ends up happening is a flip flop, but it hits your heel with the intensity of more cowbell. It isn't worth the loud [slapping](https://media.giphy.com/media/1zgOyLCRxCmV5G3GFZ/giphy.gif).
* **Canvases with no stretch**
   * Sometimes this is fine, but if you're wide you typically search for the stretchiest shoe material (See my foot condom rant) for a reason. The downside of it stretching to fit you is that the foot will spill over the sides or front, leaving it unprotected from the ground. This can lead to back issues. See Naomi Small's [season 8 entrance look](https://external-preview.redd.it/7bgA1Bn27pwwWiRU6L6XwSQ94O210ZwFH7BV61W-70o.jpg?width=1200&height=628.272251309&auto=webp&s=7a54909628fe451100056e1ca699eb61e01f64ac).

&#x200B;

# Signs a Shoe May Work Out!

* **A very adjustable ankle strap, or elastic back.** Lets you have a wide front but will fit your ""narrower"" to width ratio ankle
   * [Example](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-day-heel-brightred?collection=womens-heels)
* **Stretcher Canvas.** Like I said before, this does lead to a spill over, but this might work if the shoe sole bottom is wide enough. This is why knit flats are so popular.
   * [Example](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/skechers-cleo-flat/420522?activeColor=017&rrec=true)
* **If it... comes is a wide size!**! Okay, this one is a given
* **Not a stiff pointed toe.** This one sucks to write because I'm basically saying that a certain style won't be in your wheel house, and I love this type. However, what happens is the pointed toe goes from wide to point too quickly, and you end up either a) having a real awkward bulge in your shoe, that you may need to cover with a [binder in middle school](https://media.giphy.com/media/14dXclYKbx2ONW/giphy.gif), or b) it pinches and hurts.
* **Lots of Non Ankle Straps.** My favorite shoes tend to be ones that ""hold"" my foot in place, and straps that work across your foot, that are not in the ball part of your foot, work out really well usually. Especially if they hold across your arch.

# The Ones I've Tried.. And Probably Won't Re-buy

Now remember, just because I tried these on and had these reactions, *doesn't mean they won't work for you*. Ever person is different, and these might be the greatest shoe for you. If so, great!! But, I want to be honest in my reactions and these were ones that weren't enough for me.

* [Tieks](https://tieks.com/cobalt.html) ($175)
   * The most expensive foot condom out there! I got cobalt, but it actually is closer to a corn flower blue. Here were my opinions.
   * Pros:
      * I *loved* the bottom teal soles. And I mean they are teal. Like, sixty-year-old-aunt-who-just-loves-going-to-brunch-in-bejeweled-sandals-and-has-these-capris-in-this-color-that-just-screams-""oh, fun!"" teal. These things are Tom Hardy hardy. Nothing can get through them. I mean, when the teenage dystopian future comes, and I need something pure and tough to protect me from my Roomba Feline overlord while having a PG-13 level romantic moment with a guy with the perfect 90s [mcdonalds logo](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-05/enhanced/webdr08/23/15/original-grid-image-28196-1400875025-6.jpg?crop=588:882;19,0&downsize=400:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto) shaped hair bangs, I'm heading straight to the Tieks warehouses. I will wear my teal plated armor with pride as [I ride into battle](https://media.giphy.com/media/6901DbEbbm4o0/giphy.gif).
      * Great returns policy!
   * Cons:
      * I got an 8, they were too way too long. So I had to return, got a 7, but I could tell it's too small as my feel spill out on the side a bit. They don't do half sizes :(.
      * The inner sole is a very smooth leather. I could complain about how it quickly [tinted from sweat](https://crazytogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tieks-24-1024x684.jpg) (link to photo I found), but I have a Much Bigger Issue to bring up. You know when you wear new shoes, and you're feeling just plain sassy. I mean just feeling your stuff as your round the cubicle corner, your executive partner of your firm will walk by, and you'll realize your shoes are squeaking out a fart noise with *every single step* as your heel moves on the leather. That's right, I had to make strong eye contact to a[ssert my corporate dominance](https://media.giphy.com/media/52FcaTVc9Y1rk7q1NQ/giphy.gif) with the patriarchy while making foot fart noises. I've owned them for 6 months... and they're still fartin'.
      * The leather that is the canvas of the shoe is a bit thicker and stronger than the usual foot condoms. While I actually like a lot of that at first, it does show that they are using better materials, I had a few issue with it I didn't expect. Mostly, that because the elastic tension was stronger, it pinched my big toe down non stop. As a result, I can only wear these for about 5 hours. After words it feels like I've put a pair of [pliers](https://media.giphy.com/media/kAhYjZZlSCLRu/giphy.gif) on my giant toe nail and took an hour to undo out of the shoes. I've shoe stretched them 3 times, and still have this problem. I found a photo that shows what I mean. See the big toe [dent](https://crazytogether.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/tieks-22-1024x684.jpg)?
* [Rothy's Pointed Toe](https://rothys.com/products/the-point-black-solid) ($145)
   * Another internet favorite. I got a size 8. I really wanted to like these.
   * Pros:
      * These actually fit pretty well for the ball of my foot. I had a little spill on the side, but a lot less than usual. It did feel ""long"" but I expected that for the pointed toe.
      * The shoe sole was really strong here too.
      * Really soft!
      * I love, love, love the eco factor here. It was one of the main reasons I bought them.
   * Cons:
      * They shrank. It was *100% my fault*! They tout being washer friendly, however they are cold water *only*. They also cannot be put into the dryer. They absolutely shrink and cannot be stretched back out again. The reason why I put this in the con bucket, even though it was my fault, is that I live in a very, very hot part of the US. Heat is a natural part of life in Texas, so if I leave these in the car they can potentially heat up and shrink. I need shoes that can handle [90\*F](https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGppLes0ENI5osCc/giphy.gif) \+.
      * They *stank*. I have never, ever had a pair of shoes smell on me. These were the very first. Now, I know many would claim I should wash the soles, or buy new ones, but the smell was noticeable after only 3 wears. The only fix would be for me to buy a cloth sole, or similar. I'm willing to do that, but not from their soles. I don't know of any cloth pointed toe ones I would buy that would fit rothy's pointed toe specifically without causing more friction of my already tight foot. Now, could I find a ""sorta"" fit? Sure, but these are already shoes I ""sorta"" fit into. It feels like a sunk cost.
* Cheap Pointed Strappy Flats on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KTC4S4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ($20)
   * I've bought a number of these types online. They usually *start* well. However, every pointed leather toe I've gotten gets dented and flakes color. And, the sole isn't very supportive.
* [Dr. Scholl's Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/dr.-scholls-leader-flat/418042?activeColor=005)
   * I cannot tell you what it is about this brand, and I have gone back lots and lots of time like a booty call, but I just cannot make it work. My problem almost every time, wide or regular width, is that the inner curve of the shoe that hits my skin will always ([always](https://media.giphy.com/media/10osILvZ4ez7ws/giphy.gif)!) pinch and leave a half moon shape of red on my skin. It seems like since they're all about comfort it would work, but it just hurts that and my toe box a lot.
   * In addition, you can see the blue interior? It's actually not that much memory foam feeling. It feels kind of hard honestly.
* [Katie and Kate Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/kelly-and-katie-pirassa-ballet-flat/398237?activeColor=840&rrec=true)
   * These have the issue of they fit really well in the store... but not after an hour when my foot swells. They fool me every time!! However, I bet narrow folks would love these really tough canvas shoes.

# Shoes I Will Buy Again:

My most bought often shoes are flats and pumps. However, I included a few others here that I liked:

* **Naturalizer** (My Gold Standard)
   * These guys are *great*. They clearly make their shoe length shorter than others, so it makes it very easy for me to buy them. I've only found one where I actually had to buy wide (their pointed toe flat). I flux between 7 and 7.5. Note I *didn't* say wide! That means it's easier for me to find in store and try on since they typically have a close enough fit.
   * Here are the ones I own:
      * [Wedge Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-hydie-wedge-pump/409290?activeColor=200) in 7.5 - (I was able to play tug on hardwood in these with my 70lb dog!)
      * [Dalee Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-dalee-pump/465864?activeColor=251)  in 7 - (I own white)
      * [Brown Wide Calf Boot](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/naturalizer-kelso-wide-calf-riding-boot/461558?activeColor=204) in 7 W (I have an older version)
      * [Open Strap Sandals](https://www.amazon.com/Naturalizer-Womens-Fabric-Strappy-Sandals/dp/B071XPX2YG/ref=sr_1_16?crid=1724PUKPK2Z23&keywords=naturalizer+velcro+sandals+for+women&qid=1564330866&s=gateway&sprefix=naturalizer+velcro%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-16) in 7.5 (Don't let the Velcro strap fool you, these are a god send)
* **Ann Klein** **Sport** (Favorite for Work)
   * These guys are great for anything I need for work. They usually have a lot of elastic without it being obvious. I continual go to them for my standards. Right now I own:
      * [Black Flats](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/anne-klein-sport-oalise-flat/446556?activeColor=960) in 7
* **Sketcher's Bobs** (Slip On)
   * WE STAN MEMORY FOAM. And they donate to charities based on the designs. My favorite are the puppy ones. I own:
      * [Black Heather](https://www.amazon.com/Skechers-Womens-Plush-33910-Black-Heather/dp/B00PRA6TSA/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=sketchers+bobs&qid=1564331066&s=gateway&sr=8-2) in 7.5
* **Addias Cloud Foam Sneakers** (Fashion Sneaker)
   * Run, don't walk, to [these](https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Womens-Cloudfoam-Advantage-Sneakers/dp/B01HSIRMSE/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=adidas+women+sneakers&qid=1564282094&s=gateway&sr=8-9). These are the best. Got them at nordstrom rack for a steal. I've worn them overseas and back, and they're [GREAT](https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IvnJQAy7SGlcR2/giphy.gif).
* **Lucky Brand Ellie Flat** (Budget Buy)
   * This is borderline tiek-like, but It isn't too much that it creates that ""C"" when not worn. It doesn't have the thickest bottom, but they fit really well for what price point they come at. And the leather is really easy to stretch with a shoe stretcher.
      * [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Brand-Womens-American-Leather/dp/B00HRVXKWU/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ellie+flat&qid=1564317512&s=gateway&sr=8-2) in 7.5
* **Booties & Boots**
   * I love talking about these because my husband gets mad and thinks I mean the baby shoes (lol). No, but seriously shoes that are boots are basically a god send for wide shoe people. They're basically sneaker fits but with more professional fit. Here are ones I like:
      * [Riverberry](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010QWX1ZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (These are lasting! Great for the price)
      * [MVE](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GJYYLYY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (These have a real hearty heel, almost like a cowboy boot)
      * Target has a few great ones too
* **ModCloth T Strap Flat**
   * These have a *great* wide width, but I still had the 'pointed toe dent' issue. However, in all other ways these excel. I got a blue set with flowers on it that are a compliment magnet.
   * [Link](https://www.modcloth.com/shop/shoes/modcloth-turn-back-prime-t-strap-flat-in-navy-floral/165008.html) in 7W
* **A\*\*\*\*rbella**
   * I got some at DSW, and they're definitely the ""wear all day at work"" pair of heels. Super comfortable, but is a kitten heel. They aren't sexy, but they work! There is also a clear knit/stretch to the fabric so it's great for me. Overall though, their inner sole is really great to stand on, and they have a few other fun colors. I got away with not going W for my size
   * [Judith Pump](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/abella-judith-pump/349651?activeColor=001)
* [Clarks](https://www.amazon.com/CLARKS-Womens-Adriel-Viola-Leather/dp/B01N5CWLR4/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=clarks&qid=1564281229&s=gateway&sr=8-15) & [Life Stride](https://www.amazon.com/stores/node/2595472011?_encoding=UTF8&field-lbr_brands_browse-bin=LifeStride&ref_=w_bl_sl_ap_sh_web_2595472011)
   * I have a few heels from both of them , and they're great for the standard day to day. I'm not excited personally on their other styles, but if you need a nude heel that works, these get the job done. I found life stride though does tend to pinch after a while on the area near the arch to the top of the shoe. But I suspect I need to size up or stretch more.
   * I own:
      * [LifeStride Seemless Dress Pump (7.5W)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0117ZX5C6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Me Too](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/me-too-pacific-loafer/459726?activeColor=543)
   * These definitely can have the corporate grandma feel if you let them, but every now and then they pop out some really nice stuff. Great support inside the heel.
* [COM & SENS](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-pomaro-pump/400535?activeColor=061) (And [another](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-brunna-sandal/429890?activeColor=002), and [another](https://www.dsw.com/en/us/product/com-and-sens-missy-wedge-sandal/450318?activeColor=200)) is my new up and comer
   * They tend to have a lot of ""elastic"" elements that aren't the shoe itself. It's really great for the stretch without the shoe spill over issue. Now, their look isn't for all, as it's typically obvious it's a comfort shoe, but who cares? Do what you [wanttttt](https://media.giphy.com/media/jL0c2TrfDUz9S/giphy.gif). They also always have great arch support.

# The Shoes I'm Eyeing But Haven't Bought

* More Naturalizer (*ALWAYS*)
   * I want a blush pink flat or similar, so I'm eyeing their site.
* [CINAK Flats](https://www.amazon.com/CINAK-Women-Flats-Shoes-Slip/dp/B07DZZ7G7G/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=comfort+flats&qid=1564282006&s=gateway&sr=8-10) (Budget Pick)
* [Antonia Saint](https://www.antoniasaintny.com/)
   * Their ads are all about how it's a heel that feels like a sneaker. Very curious
* [AllBirds](https://www.allbirds.com/)

Last Updated: 10/27/2019

&#x200B;

Got some recs? Please share and I'll post them here!","my wide foot manifesto with recs im posting this on a few commented suggestions from my previous post on rothys dupes

x200b

im a 5 foot 4 inches woman 140 lbs with a larger bust im also not ideally shaped meaning i am familiar with the constant search for the short length the slim petite selections and the white whale wide width shoe as a result i am constantly shopping for clothes that actually fit yes its fun but finding something that truly fits has been an uphill battle since day zero im a programmer we start arrays at zero so me and my pizza shaped feet have been on a mission to find the ideal wide shoe spoiler the ideal shoe were the friends we found along the way

okay here are the things to know

 the bad wide shoe traits

here are things ive experienced with wide shoes that well suck some of these also apply to our narrow sisters as well

1 fewer options colorstyles
   1 wide shoes arent typically made in all the colors and models for each shoe simply because were not the key demographic according to the makers and try to cover us while making a decent overhead it is annoying because i cannot buy a pair of red shoes without significant effort a person who isnt cant do that
   2 exhibit a pumps women unfiltered search on dsw
      1 this is a set of sexy stilettos the seo here is like oh yeah firey hot red sexy lady party rock on go out on the town go the clubs party meet a sexy person be sexy take a sexy selfie oh ah oh ah only at mattress giant this is great want it in red get it in red you sexy person you yes fierce blue steel vogue go go yes into the camera make love to the camera
   3 exhibit b filtered to wide
      1 this set of shoes is reserved for the shaded area of a venn diagram consisting of matronly knitting and community college business course photos with just the right amount of diverse representation
2 settling for floppyhurtful shoes
   1 the shoes ive gotten close enough to fitting flop a lot on the end of it what happens is i buy a shoe that fits at the ball of my foot so it stays however when i step up the back of the heel flops however i am at a corporate job so i need a pair of black heels and i have a meeting on monday morning so you end up buying the pair of shoes and basically powering through until theyre broken in or you throw them out this is doubly terrible for heels because you will fall on your bum
3 theyre expensive
   1 typically theyre not only tougher to find but more expensive as with any specialty sizing like petite sizing they cost more the brands serve a smaller market and so they try to either make their money back or understand were willing to pay by asking for more in addition if there is a shoe you really love you try to make it work by stretching or adding pads this also are more costs and time for one pair of shoes
   2 note i for one am very willing to shell out cash for great shoes that fit i just havent found any
4 theyre only online
   1 like any specialty sizing theyre typically more options only online that means its a gamble when you order if it actually fits you usually have to order two only to find both dont work figures then you have to do the return dance which sucks
5 foot condoms
   1 okay this is a major pet peeve for me most if not all women own what i refer to as a foot condom these are those weirdo scrunchy shoes that leaves nothing to the imagination and arch up when not worn
      1 what are they they are little tiny wisps of fabric that are glued to your foot like a trash bag was vacuumed around your big ass toes nothing is left to the imagination no your toe cleavage may not be showing but the other feet sure as hell knows when your feet are in a cold space or feelin frisky watch out for foot matching dances they also have the shoe thickness of those slices of tomato they show on the home shopping network where theyre selling high quality japanese knives for 80 easy payments of 4 cents and need to read the newspaper through a fruit you have no protections against mini potholes arctic conference rooms or upcoming corporate singularity with these shoes however they are perfect for your upcoming costume part in bath for jane austen day and look they have a cute little bow that will annoy and bounce how quaint
      2 i hate them but i end up owning 14 pairs why they are the best fit for the weirdest feet as a result even though i think theyre kind of ugly and dont work and i need some goddess damn black flats for work you settle for them
6 harder to tailor shoes
   1 while in some cases it may work it is much harder to tailor a shoe versus a piece of clothing as a short person i can tailor my skirts or my shirts but getting my shoes widened and shortened is much harder to get done i usually have to find a shoe hospital or similar its easier to find a local dry cleaner that tailors than a shoe place

 know your official size and if youre wide

the easiest way is to get out a ruler and put your foot on it many prefer to draw around your foot on a paper on the ground then compare that then go to this site and check your length and your width i am the length of a us 7 and the width of a 75 w so im too short and wide considering my hot slice of a pizza body this matches however most of my shoes are closer to 7 or 75 as i often find its easier to stretch a shoe then shorten it

 what other things can i do to make my shoes fit better

there are a few things to expand your options sadly all of them require you to spend more cash but here ya go

 get a shoe stretcher
    i stretch all my shoes for 24 hr per shoe before i buy as i have a more short than wide foot i end up buying a size down and trying to stretch it
 buy ankle pads
    if you buy a shoe that fits your width but not your ankle you usually get a lot of flops you can add pads that sit inside the ankle however these i typically have issues with i end up having a large gap between where my ankle top hits the pad and the bottom half doesnt that leaves room for slipping around if i go in funny angles which is often
 get your shoe adjusted
    youd have to find a place in town that does this its very hit or miss per city and typically costs over 50 i wouldnt recommend this for the average shoe i did find an online place but i havent tried it

frankly these are about it if your shoe doesnt fit its either this or live with it

 shoe features to avoid in standard sizing

x200b

 strict mid ball straps example
    this is very hit or miss if there is a strap right across the ball of the foot it might be the perfect width if you size up but that only works if you got a very adjustable ankle strap if you do it works out nicely since you just size up and adjust that if you dont then you end up just rubbing up against it like a dog in heat
 peep toe
    usually i never have the right foot to length ratio to make my foot cleavage make all the foot boys come to my foot yard
 mules
    these are shoes that are covered in the front half but not the back they just never really work what ends up happening is a flip flop but it hits your heel with the intensity of more cowbell it isnt worth the loud slapping
 canvases with no stretch
    sometimes this is fine but if youre wide you typically search for the stretchiest shoe material see my foot condom rant for a reason the downside of it stretching to fit you is that the foot will spill over the sides or front leaving it unprotected from the ground this can lead to back issues see naomi smalls season 8 entrance look

x200b

 signs a shoe may work out

 a very adjustable ankle strap or elastic back lets you have a wide front but will fit your narrower to width ratio ankle
    example
 stretcher canvas like i said before this does lead to a spill over but this might work if the shoe sole bottom is wide enough this is why knit flats are so popular
    example
 if it comes is a wide size okay this one is a given
 not a stiff pointed toe this one sucks to write because im basically saying that a certain style wont be in your wheel house and i love this type however what happens is the pointed toe goes from wide to point too quickly and you end up either a having a real awkward bulge in your shoe that you may need to cover with a binder in middle school or b it pinches and hurts
 lots of non ankle straps my favorite shoes tend to be ones that hold my foot in place and straps that work across your foot that are not in the ball part of your foot work out really well usually especially if they hold across your arch

 the ones ive tried and probably wont rebuy

now remember just because i tried these on and had these reactions doesnt mean they wont work for you ever person is different and these might be the greatest shoe for you if so great but i want to be honest in my reactions and these were ones that werent enough for me

 tieks 175
    the most expensive foot condom out there i got cobalt but it actually is closer to a corn flower blue here were my opinions
    pros
       i loved the bottom teal soles and i mean they are teal like sixtyyearoldauntwhojustlovesgoingtobrunchinbejeweledsandalsandhasthesecaprisinthiscolorthatjustscreamsoh fun teal these things are tom hardy hardy nothing can get through them i mean when the teenage dystopian future comes and i need something pure and tough to protect me from my roomba feline overlord while having a pg13 level romantic moment with a guy with the perfect 90s mcdonalds logo shaped hair bangs im heading straight to the tieks warehouses i will wear my teal plated armor with pride as i ride into battle
       great returns policy
    cons
       i got an 8 they were too way too long so i had to return got a 7 but i could tell its too small as my feel spill out on the side a bit they dont do half sizes 
       the inner sole is a very smooth leather i could complain about how it quickly tinted from sweat link to photo i found but i have a much bigger issue to bring up you know when you wear new shoes and youre feeling just plain sassy i mean just feeling your stuff as your round the cubicle corner your executive partner of your firm will walk by and youll realize your shoes are squeaking out a fart noise with every single step as your heel moves on the leather thats right i had to make strong eye contact to assert my corporate dominance with the patriarchy while making foot fart noises ive owned them for 6 months and theyre still fartin
       the leather that is the canvas of the shoe is a bit thicker and stronger than the usual foot condoms while i actually like a lot of that at first it does show that they are using better materials i had a few issue with it i didnt expect mostly that because the elastic tension was stronger it pinched my big toe down non stop as a result i can only wear these for about 5 hours after words it feels like ive put a pair of pliers on my giant toe nail and took an hour to undo out of the shoes ive shoe stretched them 3 times and still have this problem i found a photo that shows what i mean see the big toe dent
 rothys pointed toe 145
    another internet favorite i got a size 8 i really wanted to like these
    pros
       these actually fit pretty well for the ball of my foot i had a little spill on the side but a lot less than usual it did feel long but i expected that for the pointed toe
       the shoe sole was really strong here too
       really soft
       i love love love the eco factor here it was one of the main reasons i bought them
    cons
       they shrank it was 100 my fault they tout being washer friendly however they are cold water only they also cannot be put into the dryer they absolutely shrink and cannot be stretched back out again the reason why i put this in the con bucket even though it was my fault is that i live in a very very hot part of the us heat is a natural part of life in texas so if i leave these in the car they can potentially heat up and shrink i need shoes that can handle 90f 
       they stank i have never ever had a pair of shoes smell on me these were the very first now i know many would claim i should wash the soles or buy new ones but the smell was noticeable after only 3 wears the only fix would be for me to buy a cloth sole or similar im willing to do that but not from their soles i dont know of any cloth pointed toe ones i would buy that would fit rothys pointed toe specifically without causing more friction of my already tight foot now could i find a sorta fit sure but these are already shoes i sorta fit into it feels like a sunk cost
 cheap pointed strappy flats on amazon 20
    ive bought a number of these types online they usually start well however every pointed leather toe ive gotten gets dented and flakes color and the sole isnt very supportive
 dr scholls flats
    i cannot tell you what it is about this brand and i have gone back lots and lots of time like a booty call but i just cannot make it work my problem almost every time wide or regular width is that the inner curve of the shoe that hits my skin will always always pinch and leave a half moon shape of red on my skin it seems like since theyre all about comfort it would work but it just hurts that and my toe box a lot
    in addition you can see the blue interior its actually not that much memory foam feeling it feels kind of hard honestly
 katie and kate flats
    these have the issue of they fit really well in the store but not after an hour when my foot swells they fool me every time however i bet narrow folks would love these really tough canvas shoes

 shoes i will buy again

my most bought often shoes are flats and pumps however i included a few others here that i liked

 naturalizer my gold standard
    these guys are great they clearly make their shoe length shorter than others so it makes it very easy for me to buy them ive only found one where i actually had to buy wide their pointed toe flat i flux between 7 and 75 note i didnt say wide that means its easier for me to find in store and try on since they typically have a close enough fit

       dalee pump  in 7  i own white
       brown wide calf boot in 7 w i have an older version

 addias cloud foam sneakers fashion sneaker
    run dont walk to these these are the best got them at nordstrom rack for a steal ive worn them overseas and back and theyre great
 lucky brand ellie flat budget buy
    this is borderline tieklike but it isnt too much that it creates that c when not worn it doesnt have the thickest bottom but they fit really well for what price point they come at and the leather is really easy to stretch with a shoe stretcher
       link in 75
 booties  boots
    i love talking about these because my husband gets mad and thinks i mean the baby shoes lol no but seriously shoes that are boots are basically a god send for wide shoe people theyre basically sneaker fits but with more professional fit here are ones i like
       riverberry these are lasting great for the price
       mve these have a real hearty heel almost like a cowboy boot
       target has a few great ones too
 modcloth t strap flat
    these have a great wide width but i still had the pointed toe dent issue however in all other ways these excel i got a blue set with flowers on it that are a compliment magnet
    link in 7w
 arbella
    i got some at dsw and theyre definitely the wear all day at work pair of heels super comfortable but is a kitten heel they arent sexy but they work there is also a clear knitstretch to the fabric so its great for me overall though their inner sole is really great to stand on and they have a few other fun colors i got away with not going w for my size
    judith pump
 clarks  life stride
    i have a few heels from both of them  and theyre great for the standard day to day im not excited personally on their other styles but if you need a nude heel that works these get the job done i found life stride though does tend to pinch after a while on the area near the arch to the top of the shoe but i suspect i need to size up or stretch more
    i own
       lifestride seemless dress pump 75w
 me too
    these definitely can have the corporate grandma feel if you let them but every now and then they pop out some really nice stuff great support inside the heel
 com  sens and another and another is my new up and comer
    they tend to have a lot of elastic elements that arent the shoe itself its really great for the stretch without the shoe spill over issue now their look isnt for all as its typically obvious its a comfort shoe but who cares do what you wanttttt they also always have great arch support

I don't know how to explain it other than I am really lazy and want to feel like I am walking on clothes without looking like I have no clue about fashion- because I do. I just don't know which trainers are comfy.



Bonus points if water proof as I will most likely have to walk in splashy puddles.

femalefashionadvice,allbirds,What Are Your Favorite Walking Shoes?,"In searching this sub for recommendations, I noticed that there are lots of one-off questions about shoes that are comfortable for walking, but no single thread for it. So I figured I'd start one!

I like walking places as much as I can, and I used to live in cities where I took public transportation and walked a lot. The shoes that I've put the most miles on are:

* My Doc Martens 1460s. These are the clear winners in my mileage ranking. Once you break these babies in, they're super comfortable and you can spend all day wearing them. I'm actually on my second pair of them because I wore my first pair out after putting them through Midwest winters and a year of farm work. They go with everything, and as far as I'm concerned, they'll never go out of style. 

* My Vans Authentics. These were my (fair weather) daily walk-commuting shoes for a year, although I think I may be approaching the end of their life. I've done a lot of traveling and walking in them as well, and while I've really liked them, I think I want something with a little more support when I replace them soon. They basically go with everything, and I've found them to be a great low-key casual sneaker for just about every outfit.

* My Saltwater Sandals. I've been wearing these for three summers straight and they still look new. You wouldn't think they'd be very comfortable, but I've walked all over in them and not had sore feet at the end of the day. They're not super trendy or elegant looking, but they're cute enough and I get compliments on mine all the time!

* Various Teva hiking sandals. I've used these for summer hikes, long summer walks, and outdoor summer work, and I've yet to be disappointed. My first pair was a bit more ""outdoorsy"" looking, but I recently replaced those with a pair of pure black Originals, which have integrated into my outfits pretty well.

A huge caveat to my list of favorites is that I have very tough feet and low to medium arches, so I don't tend to need a lot of support to be happy. 

What about you? What shoes have you put the most miles on? What are your HG shoes that you can walk all day in but still look cute for dinner out? What are your go-tos if you know you'll be on your feet all day? What shoes do you always bring with you when you travel? What are your feet picky about, and what shoes make them happy?

femalefashionadvice,allbirds,What shoes do you like for conferences or casual team trips?,"I went to a tech conference recently, pathetically attempting to break in my newest attempt at black flats while everyone else was wearing ankle boots. Classic.

I work from home, so feel very out of the loop. I travel a handful of times a year for conferences, casual team get togethers, etc. It's always a challenge to try to figure out how to modify my wardrobe for these.

What shoes do you wear for these types of events? In particular, which are the most comfortable for crazy long days that extend from conference to dinner to ""kill me now, I'm melting into an introverted puddle"".

Also, 2 of my trips will be in Florida this year so points for warm-weather friendly shoes too.

Edit:
TLDR:

  - Bring jacket/shawl/scarf/sweater/etc because indoor temperatures will always be cold

EDIT: Added a brand based off u/[tyrannosaurusregina](https://www.reddit.com/user/tyrannosaurusregina/) 's comment!","the rise of the rothy dupes i am a very wide shoe wearer so i try to be conscious of all the flats in the world the reason being as a consultant i wear them out like nuts as im on my feet often but need to look professional

x200b

however ive noticed recently a huge rise in the rothy wannabes this is really useful for some people that like the idea of them but either cannot afford the price tag or similar for me i actually really enjoyed my rothys until i shrank them which was on me but they did tend to stink with my foot sweat i was wondering if a different material would help but some of these look like literal copies

so while i havent bought all of these here are the list of rothy dupes i have found some even have the blue stripe on the back

femalefashionadvice,allbirds,"High levels of BPA found in sports bras, athletic shirts","https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/business/bpa-sports-bras/index.html

New testing on a variety of popular branded sports bras and athletic wear has revealed high levels of BPA, a chemical compound that‚Äôs used to make certain types of plastic and can lead to harmful health effects such as asthma, cardiovascular disease and obesity. 

Sports bras sold by Athleta, PINK, Asics, The North Face, Brooks, All in Motion, Nike, and FILA were all tested for BPA in the past six months, and the results showed the clothing could expose wearers to up to 22 times the safe limit of BPA, based on standards set in California, according to the Center for Environmental Health. The CEH, which conducted the testing, is a non-profit consumer advocacy group focused on exposing the presence of toxic chemicals in consumer products. 

Under California law ‚Äî specifically Proposition 65, enacted in 1986 ‚Äî the maximum allowable dose level for BPA via skin exposure is 3 micrograms per day. 

The group also tested athletic shirts from brands that included The North Face, Brooks, Mizuno, Athleta, New Balance, and Reebok and found similar results. 

The CEH said Wednesday it has sent legal notices to the companies, which will have 60 days to work with the center to remedy the violations before the group files a complaint in California state court requiring them to do so. 

To date, the watchdog said its investigations have found BPA only in polyester-based clothing containing spandex. ‚ÄúWe want brands to reformulate their products to remove all bisphenols including BPA. In the interim, we recommend limiting the time you spend in your activewear by changing after your workout,‚Äù the group said. 

Athleta, Nike, Reebok, The North Face and Victoria‚Äôs Secret (which owns PINK) did not immediately provide a comment. 

BPA (Bisphenol A) is found in a large number of everyday products, from water bottles and canned foods to toys and flooring. In adults, exposure to BPA has been linked to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity and erectile dysfunction. 

Premature death was also associated with BPA exposure, a 2020 study found. More recently, BPA has also been linked to asthma in school-age girls. 

‚ÄúPeople are exposed to BPA through ingestion, from eating food or drinking water from containers that have leached BPA, or by absorption through skin,‚Äù Kaya Allan Sugerman, CEH‚Äôs illegal toxic threats program director, said in a statement. 

‚ÄúStudies have shown that BPA can be absorbed through skin and end up in the bloodstream after handling receipt paper for seconds or a few minutes at a time. Sports bras and athletic shirts are worn for hours at a time, and you are meant to sweat in them, so it is concerning to be finding such high levels of BPA in our clothing,‚Äù Allan Sugerman said. 

Over the past year, the group has asked more than 90 companies, including Walgreens and socks and sleepwear brand Hypnotic Hats, to reformulate their products to remove all bisphenols, including BPA. Some have already agreed to do so. 

‚ÄúEven low levels of exposure [to BPA] during pregnancy have been associated with a variety of health problems in offspring,‚Äù said Dr. Jimena D√≠az Leiva, science director with CEH. 

Although CEH litigates under California‚Äôs Clean Drinking Water and Toxics Enforcement Act of 1986, it says the repercussions of its settlements extend beyond California ‚Äúas it is most often economically infeasible for companies to reformulate for just the California market.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOur legal action has been successful in pushing entire industries to remove certain chemicals from products like children‚Äôs candy or toys,‚Äù the group said in a statement to CNN Business. ‚ÄúThese cases not only serve to protect California consumers but also consumers throughout the country.‚Äù",1666033511.0,"High levels of BPA found in sports bras, athletic shirts https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/business/bpa-sports-bras/index.html

femalefashionadvice,allbirds,What kind of sneakers are in style now?,"I'm in the market for a new pair of sneakers for casual wear, but I'm feeling lost. I'm interested in getting a pair of shoes that feels current and can go with a lot of outfits. They don't have to be super cutting edge, but I'd rather not get something quite as ubiquitous as white Converses. 

My budget is under $75. Still, I'd be interested in hearing about more expensive sneakers to see if I can approximate the look. Thanks!



edit: Thanks for all these great suggestions! Note: I don't mean ""ubiquitous"" in a negative way at all. I just mean, I'd rather not buy a shoe that's seen everywhere, or has been such a classic for so long. There are lots of good reasons to get a tried-and-true staple, and white Converses look great, but I'm in the mood for something slightly more unique. I'm trying to find something between ""on the bleeding edge of fashion, no one has these yet"" and ""if you go out, you'll definitely see someone else wearing the same shoes as you."" 

That's kind of hard to approximate for any given region, so I still appreciate the discussion about what you see everywhere, because I haven't really been paying attention to sneakers lately.

femalefashionadvice,stella mccartney,How do I maximize clothing quality while minimizing overspending?,"Hello all! Hope Monday is treating you guys reasonably well.

At the beginning of the summer, I began to work at my first real job out of college and I was suddenly able to afford to shop at places other than H&M and Forever21. I have in the past occasionally shopped at J-Crew, Banana Republic, etc, but I still haven't found the quality of a lot of their clothing to be much better than other fast fashion stores. I began to look more heavily into buying a few designer pieces, as I have always loved a lot of designer clothing, but I am having a hard time convincing myself that the clothing itself is worth the incredibly high price tag. 

For example, I have found my $90 Levi's jeans to be hugely superior to the $30 American Eagle jeans I used to wear, but I have tried on a few pairs of Paige Denim and have never been impressed enough to spend the $180-$200 per pair. While the Paige Denim is still better, the difference in quality between Paige and Levi's does not seem to be as big as the quality difference between Levi's and American Eagle. 

Have any of you found brands that sit in the sweet spot of maximizing quality while minimizing cost? Diminishing returns seems to affect fashion pretty heavily, and if I could find a few brands that have coats *almost* as nice as the Stella McCartney Bryce coat *without* the $1400 price tag, I would be super grateful!

I began to look more heavily into buying a few designer pieces, as I have always loved a lot of designer clothing, but I am having a hard time convincing myself that the clothing itself is worth the incredibly high price tag. 

For example, I have found my $90 Levi's jeans to be hugely superior to the $30 American Eagle jeans I used to wear, but I have tried on a few pairs of Paige Denim and have never been impressed enough to spend the $180-$200 per pair. While the Paige Denim is still better, the difference in quality between Paige and Levi's does not seem to be as big as the quality difference between Levi's and American Eagle. 

Have any of you found brands that sit in the sweet spot of maximizing quality while minimizing cost? Diminishing returns seems to affect fashion pretty heavily, and if I could find a few brands that have coats *almost* as nice as the Stella McCartney Bryce coat *without* the $1400 price tag, I would be super grateful! 

Thanks for the help :) ","how do i maximize clothing quality while minimizing overspending hello all hope monday is treating you guys reasonably well

femalefashionadvice,stella mccartney,How To Add Visual Interest To Summer Outfits,"One question that pops up incredibly often on this sub once high temperatures hit is how to make warm weather wear looks‚Ä¶interesting. The disconnect seems to occur because for fall/winter dressing, there is more texture and more layering to play with, so it‚Äôs easier to create an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù rather than just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù. When you‚Äôre only wearing one layer, that becomes more difficult and the outfit you‚Äôre trying to put together can leave something to be desired, as it‚Äôs plain and stripped back. 


But you don‚Äôt have to layer 3 types of clothes in order to maintain style going into the warmer months. Warm weather has endless opportunities for fashionable dressing, and in the glorious absence of a big coat that covers up all your hard work, you‚Äôre free to show off an outfit that plays with colors, proportions, textures, patterns, or interesting accessories. 


I know summer is technically on its way out, but a lot of us still have at least a month or two of hot weather to go, so let‚Äôs take a look at putting together some cool summer outfits. 





# Color





Perhaps more than anything else, warm weather is an excellent opportunity to enjoy color. While no one‚Äôs stopping you from wearing colorful clothes in the winter, it‚Äôs clear that cold weather tends to be a sad mass of black - mostly for practical reasons. 


But when the sun is shining and there are no coats covering up your outfit, you can bring out the yellows, the pinks, the greens - and they can be the key to taking your attire from just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù to an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 







## color blocking




Color blocking is a tried and true method to add visual interest. Color in an outfit always brings it up a step, but color blocking requires more skill, and more attention paid to silhouette, as well as color pairings. You can opt for colors opposite on the color wheel, or just colors that feel right to you - there are no rules, as long as you love the result.

##pop of color




Opting for just a pop of color can be a great way to make your outfit more fun, but without the difficulty of pairing colors together. The easiest way to do it is to add a colorful bag to an otherwise neutral outfit. A lavender bag can give a little contrast to a basic white dress and elevate it to an outfit. Especially if you‚Äôre also pairing it with a colorful pair of shoes. Matching shoes are fine, but an even more interesting choice is a pair of shoes in a complementary color.

## monochrome



Probably a lot of us have worn all-black before, but how many have tried the same in a different color? What is boring and safe in black becomes infinitely more stylish and interesting in a bold color that goes great with a tan. Think about an all pink outfit and what a statement it makes. It‚Äôs still really easy to put together - you‚Äôre only using one color - and yet, it‚Äôs anything but boring.

##tonal dressing



Pairing colors together can be tricky and it‚Äôs often a barrier of entry to fashion for the regular person. But there are easy, somewhat prescriptive ways to do it, like tonal dressing. Not quite monochrome, tonal dressing is more about picking different shades of the same base color or color palette. Adjacent colors, if you will. Both a step above monochrome, and easier than finding identical shades to match, tonal dressing is more visually exciting than a monochromatic outfit, while still being a subtle way to do color.

# Pattern




Perhaps an obvious suggestion, pattern pulls an outfit right out of its boring, solid color nothingness and gives it purpose, it gives it oomph, it gives it visual interest. Where things really get interesting is when you pattern match - or clash. But that‚Äôs a somewhat ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù lesson. For now, even something as simple as choosing a floral skirt instead of a solid colored one can make your clothes an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 




## floral




Yes, yes, florals for spring are not groundbreaking. But we have to walk before we can run. Florals are common, and they‚Äôre easy. A very seasonally-appropriate pattern for spring-summer, it adds a touch of whimsy and femininity to an otherwise simple outfit.

## polka dots & stripes




Polka dots and stripes are other classic patterns you can‚Äôt really go wrong with. They typically still come in neutral colors, for the most part, but you can also find them in more fun colors if you don‚Äôt want to stick to boring black and white. 





[polka dot stripe 1](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/RzQInQUaJ0rAllC55iDgnDgJGCc/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/04/16/723/n/1922564/34e32d3acdad2cc7_GettyImages-1014456228/i/Summer-Fashion-Trends-Polka-Dots.jpg)

## abstract




Then, of course, we‚Äôve got the cooler, more modern abstract prints. Paint splotches, random shapes, approximations of faces - anything goes. Why wear a basic white shirt, when you can wear an interesting one?

## gingham




Gingham is a classic summer staple. Casual and light, it‚Äôs a quintessential ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù print. Black and white gingham is a good neutral option, but if you want something more fun, any pastel color + white is very summery while still maintaining visual interest.

## pattern clashing




Of course, the ultimate way to wear pattern is to clash it against more pattern. A higher difficulty task, but with a big visual reward, pattern clashing can make even the most boring, basic outfit look elevated.

# Texture






When you‚Äôve not got many pieces to work with for an outfit, those pieces have to work much harder to be interesting, to stand out, to be ‚Äúworthy‚Äù. In comes texture. An outfit that‚Äôs cotton from top to bottom is not much of an outfit. It‚Äôs plain, flat, and boring. Mixing silk and organza, however, becomes an event. 






## linen/cotton
Linen and cotton are the fabrics of choice for many during the summer. It‚Äôs easy to see why - they keep you cool, they feel nice, and they‚Äôre easy to find on the highstreet at decent prices. Plus, they tend to last - if slightly discolored from the sun. A good basis that you can add to.

## sheer (tulle, gauze, organza)




Sheer is having a huge moment, and now is the time to take full advantage. Despite it being mainly synthetic fabrics, the thinness, sheerness, volume and lightweight quality of these fabrics means they can be easily worn during the height of summer without fear of heatstroke. Beautiful, diaphanous, and eminently *special*, a sheer element can bring the whimsy you need for a wedding outfit, the femininity to a date outfit, or that special je n‚Äôest ce quoi to a simple brunch outfit.

## silk




Silk is in no way as fanciful as it‚Äôs touted to be, and it has the excellent advantage of being a great light-weight option for hot weather. Especially if you need something special or formal, there‚Äôs nothing better than silk. It looks amazing, it‚Äôs cool, and it packs small. 





[silk 1](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f924d19f7456d89b10b40f/1600694299266-G51G911O4WK09YVYWOHI/11+Honore+Fall+Styles)

## seersucker



A quintessential summer fabric if there ever was one, seersucker is great for a variety of clothes. Since it‚Äôs so light, it allows you to wear more formal or covered up garments, such as an elegant seersucker suit that would be hot in any other fabric. 




[seersucker 1](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ppkMIfMKA8A/WRu6WZr0T7I/AAAAAAAAXmc/fwbxEejfy1ciW1iw4xBaVr7Xg4lab4XNACEw/s1600/eloquii%2Bseersuker%2Bdress%2B%2Bboater%2Bhat%2Bplus%2Bsize%2Boutfit.jpg)

##muslin




With a slightly ‚Äúcrinkled‚Äù texture, muslin is casual in nature, and it brings visual interest all on its own. Sure, it may not be ideal for a sleek outfit, but it‚Äôs perfect for a billowy sleeveless dress when it‚Äôs too hot to put anything else on, but you still want it to look ~interesting~.

# Proportions & silhouette 





My personal favorite, playing with proportion and silhouette is a subtle and sophisticated way to create An Outfit if you‚Äôre not into accessorizing or it‚Äôs too hot to pile on the necklaces. Structural and sleek, this type of outfit allows shapes to speak for themselves and become the main event, with minimal other distractions. 





## loose on loose



There is no better season to do loose on loose than summer, especially if you prefer not to show skin. As cute as tight dresses are, this is not the time to pull them out. Instead, a pair of cropped wide leg pants can work surprisingly well with a boxy shirt with billowy sleeves. The silhouette is interesting on its own, you don‚Äôt have fabric touching your skin, and you‚Äôre not getting sunburned. All in all, 10/10 summer outfit.

## tight on loose




That isn‚Äôt to say that we can‚Äôt do tight + loose in hot weather, you just have to be more strategic about it. It‚Äôs still a visually interesting silhouette, but in the summer, the tight element should be the top, paired with a looser skirt or pair of pants. A bodycon tanktop or crop top with a pair of high-waisted linen shorts is as elegant as it is cooling.

## structural/architectural detailing 





Sometimes, a single piece with strong architectural detailing can bring all the pizzazz you need. In recent years, with the ushering in of maximalist tendencies, there‚Äôs been no shortage of interesting structural details on summer clothes. A short, but wonderfully voluminous dress is both a statement and a clever way to stay cool. Same with very wide pants, a long column silhouette, intense pleating on a skirt, or an interesting neckline. Unexpected accessories like very chunky shoes paired with a very short dress or a very small purse with a voluminous outfit can also provide that extra kick.

# Interesting details




Seemingly small details can go a long way in elevating a piece, so don‚Äôt discount the power that beading can have, straps, buckles, or even buttons. Some of these details will work better for evening than daytime, but it entire depends on your style, the type of embellishment, and the occasion. Daytime sequins are acceptable outside of Vegas now, I‚Äôm just saying. 






## embellishment




Simple shapes can still look amazing, if you add a little bling. The addition of sequins, rhinestones, or intricate beading can turn a forgettable dress into something special. The best part is that this can be DIY-ed, especially if you have a dress you‚Äôre a little tired of or that is a tad boring. You can be as restrained or as crazy as you want with your embellishments. Pearl straps, bejeweled necklines, or full sequinned pieces - they‚Äôre always a show-stopper.

## straps



With enough sunscreen, or a disregard for unconventional tan lines, something as simple as strap placement can make an outfit more interesting. Very strappy tops are very in right now, as are tops and dresses with open backs with special detailing, like tie-backs, bows, or cut-outs in different shapes.

## buckles, knots, pleating, buttons





Other distinct visual details that can also be utilitarian also help draw the eye, add some contrast, and zuzh up your outfit. Whether it‚Äôs a simple row of contrasting buttons, some statement hardware in the form of a special belt buckle, or gorgeous pleating, these details can say a lot without trying too hard.

# Accessories


Sometimes, the easiest way to do it is just to add accessories. It requires less fussing, and you don‚Äôt have to think as much about them. The biggest bonus here is that accessories rarely make you hotter, but they can still have a huge visual impact and totally ‚Äúmake‚Äù an outfit. 



## textured/colorful/big or small bag




A bag should never be an afterthought, but that‚Äôs especially important to remember when putting together summer outfits. Because you have fewer elements to play with, each of them becomes more important and ‚Äúweighs‚Äù more in the overall structure of your look. 


A very big or very small bag is a tried and true way to bring the unexpected, but you can also achieve a similar effect if you pick a bag that is colorful, or that‚Äôs textured. Consider giving your black leather bags a rest, and instead, enjoying wicker baskets, wooden bags, braided bags, and other unique textures or shapes. Summer is the time for the novelty bag to shine.

## interesting shoes - size, color, heel shape, embellishments




Of course, shoes are also essential. Not just because you literally cannot create an outfit without them, but because they can also weigh heavily in the balance of your outfit. Luckily for us, statement shoes are in, and there‚Äôs plenty to play with in terms of features. Chunky shoes are du jour, but there are also very strappy shoes out there, interesting heel shapes, high platforms, shiny embellishments, and shockingly neon colors.

## hats 



If you‚Äôve ever wished you could wear hats, but were afraid you‚Äôd look like an asshole, now is your time. You have plausible deniability, hats are not just stylish, but they‚Äôre useful, or even necessary, if you live somewhere where the sun is particularly oppressive. Shout out to Australia, the skin cancer capital of the world. 


A straw hat can complete an outfit or push it towards a certain vibe. Chic Gondolier with a breton tee and black shorts? Add a hat. Jungle Adventurer dressed head to toe in new-wave Banana Republic? Add a hat. Baptist Church Lady-core with a ruffly floral dress? Add a hat.

# Third Piece



The third piece is, of course, a basic ‚Äúrule‚Äù for outfit creation, but hot weather makes it just a little bit more difficult, when even one layer of clothing feels like too much to bear. Thankfully, you can ‚Äúcheat‚Äù and still add your third piece, but without adding extra bulk on top of an outfit you‚Äôre already overheating in. 






## linen blazer




For evenings and A/C environments, a linen blazer is very versatile and makes almost any outfit better. It works great with little dresses, shorts, wide leg linen pants - it flatters elegant outfits and beautifully contrasts more casual ones. You really can‚Äôt go wrong, and you also can‚Äôt overheat.

## vests




A more summer-y version of the blazer, the vest is not just very fashionable at the moment, it‚Äôs also the perfect layering piece. Adding minimal bulk, but maximum visual interest, a vest can be paired with anything, from dresses to shirts & shorts, to wearing it by itself as a top. The vest + shorts or vest + pleated pants combo reigns supreme for the spring/summer season; it‚Äôs sophisticated, a little masculine, and a nice departure from typical summer outfits.

## fanny pack/cross body



Any bag can make a good third piece, as we‚Äôve discussed, but a fanny pack worn crossbody is more visible, in many ways, it‚Äôs very cool, and it can be very flattering. Worn on top of a straighter, looser, or more billowy top or dress, it creates some necessary shaping, while still maintaining the casual vibe. Wear it in a contrasting color or interesting texture for maximum effect.

## maximalist jewelry



Jewelry may be the easy way out, but one cannot deny the effect of a truly big-ass pair of earrings with an otherwise simple outfit. Necklaces, rings, and bracelets are not to be ignored, and can also work beautifully to accent an outfit or your great tan, but earrings have the advantage of not touching your skin and they also bring attention to your face, and look great with your hair up - a must, in hot weather.

# What's the bottom line?


Summer dressing can be just as fun as dressing for cooler weather, just in a different way. Layering is not the only way to create something that feels like An Outfit, and sophistication and visual interest are completely achievable in hot weather, even while remaining cool. The examples shown here aren‚Äôt meant to be a rulebook to follow, but serve more as inspiration for your own wardrobe and can hopefully give you some ideas on ways to fall in love with your summer wardrobe.

https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11cp9nb/your_wardrobe_is_outdated_what_now_step_1_skinny/



https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11m7yxr/updating_an_outdated_wardrobe_part_2_office_wear/",1692543078.0,"How To Add Visual Interest To Summer Outfits One question that pops up incredibly often on this sub once high temperatures hit is how to make warm weather wear looks‚Ä¶interesting. The disconnect seems to occur because for fall/winter dressing, there is more texture and more layering to play with, so it‚Äôs easier to create an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù rather than just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù. When you‚Äôre only wearing one layer, that becomes more difficult and the outfit you‚Äôre trying to put together can leave something to be desired, as it‚Äôs plain and stripped back. 


But you don‚Äôt have to layer 3 types of clothes in order to maintain style going into the warmer months. Warm weather has endless opportunities for fashionable dressing, and in the glorious absence of a big coat that covers up all your hard work, you‚Äôre free to show off an outfit that plays with colors, proportions, textures, patterns, or interesting accessories. 


I know summer is technically on its way out, but a lot of us still have at least a month or two of hot weather to go, so let‚Äôs take a look at putting together some cool summer outfits. 





# Color





Perhaps more than anything else, warm weather is an excellent opportunity to enjoy color. While no one‚Äôs stopping you from wearing colorful clothes in the winter, it‚Äôs clear that cold weather tends to be a sad mass of black - mostly for practical reasons. 


But when the sun is shining and there are no coats covering up your outfit, you can bring out the yellows, the pinks, the greens - and they can be the key to taking your attire from just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù to an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 







## color blocking




Color blocking is a tried and true method to add visual interest. Color in an outfit always brings it up a step, but color blocking requires more skill, and more attention paid to silhouette, as well as color pairings. You can opt for colors opposite on the color wheel, or just colors that feel right to you - there are no rules, as long as you love the result.

##pop of color




Opting for just a pop of color can be a great way to make your outfit more fun, but without the difficulty of pairing colors together. The easiest way to do it is to add a colorful bag to an otherwise neutral outfit. A lavender bag can give a little contrast to a basic white dress and elevate it to an outfit. Especially if you‚Äôre also pairing it with a colorful pair of shoes. Matching shoes are fine, but an even more interesting choice is a pair of shoes in a complementary color.

## monochrome



Probably a lot of us have worn all-black before, but how many have tried the same in a different color? What is boring and safe in black becomes infinitely more stylish and interesting in a bold color that goes great with a tan. Think about an all pink outfit and what a statement it makes. It‚Äôs still really easy to put together - you‚Äôre only using one color - and yet, it‚Äôs anything but boring.

##tonal dressing



Pairing colors together can be tricky and it‚Äôs often a barrier of entry to fashion for the regular person. But there are easy, somewhat prescriptive ways to do it, like tonal dressing. Not quite monochrome, tonal dressing is more about picking different shades of the same base color or color palette. Adjacent colors, if you will. Both a step above monochrome, and easier than finding identical shades to match, tonal dressing is more visually exciting than a monochromatic outfit, while still being a subtle way to do color.

# Pattern




Perhaps an obvious suggestion, pattern pulls an outfit right out of its boring, solid color nothingness and gives it purpose, it gives it oomph, it gives it visual interest. Where things really get interesting is when you pattern match - or clash. But that‚Äôs a somewhat ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù lesson. For now, even something as simple as choosing a floral skirt instead of a solid colored one can make your clothes an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 




## floral




Yes, yes, florals for spring are not groundbreaking. But we have to walk before we can run. Florals are common, and they‚Äôre easy. A very seasonally-appropriate pattern for spring-summer, it adds a touch of whimsy and femininity to an otherwise simple outfit.

## polka dots & stripes




Polka dots and stripes are other classic patterns you can‚Äôt really go wrong with. They typically still come in neutral colors, for the most part, but you can also find them in more fun colors if you don‚Äôt want to stick to boring black and white.

## abstract




Then, of course, we‚Äôve got the cooler, more modern abstract prints. Paint splotches, random shapes, approximations of faces - anything goes. Why wear a basic white shirt, when you can wear an interesting one?

## gingham




Gingham is a classic summer staple. Casual and light, it‚Äôs a quintessential ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù print. Black and white gingham is a good neutral option, but if you want something more fun, any pastel color + white is very summery while still maintaining visual interest.

## pattern clashing




Of course, the ultimate way to wear pattern is to clash it against more pattern. A higher difficulty task, but with a big visual reward, pattern clashing can make even the most boring, basic outfit look elevated.

# Texture






When you‚Äôve not got many pieces to work with for an outfit, those pieces have to work much harder to be interesting, to stand out, to be ‚Äúworthy‚Äù. In comes texture. An outfit that‚Äôs cotton from top to bottom is not much of an outfit. It‚Äôs plain, flat, and boring. Mixing silk and organza, however, becomes an event. 






## linen/cotton
Linen and cotton are the fabrics of choice for many during the summer. It‚Äôs easy to see why - they keep you cool, they feel nice, and they‚Äôre easy to find on the highstreet at decent prices. Plus, they tend to last - if slightly discolored from the sun. A good basis that you can add to.

## sheer (tulle, gauze, organza)




Sheer is having a huge moment, and now is the time to take full advantage. Despite it being mainly synthetic fabrics, the thinness, sheerness, volume and lightweight quality of these fabrics means they can be easily worn during the height of summer without fear of heatstroke. Beautiful, diaphanous, and eminently *special*, a sheer element can bring the whimsy you need for a wedding outfit, the femininity to a date outfit, or that special je n‚Äôest ce quoi to a simple brunch outfit.

## silk




Silk is in no way as fanciful as it‚Äôs touted to be, and it has the excellent advantage of being a great light-weight option for hot weather. Especially if you need something special or formal, there‚Äôs nothing better than silk. It looks amazing, it‚Äôs cool, and it packs small.

## seersucker



A quintessential summer fabric if there ever was one, seersucker is great for a variety of clothes. Since it‚Äôs so light, it allows you to wear more formal or covered up garments, such as an elegant seersucker suit that would be hot in any other fabric. 




[seersucker 1](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ppkMIfMKA8A/WRu6WZr0T7I/AAAAAAAAXmc/fwbxEejfy1ciW1iw4xBaVr7Xg4lab4XNACEw/s1600/eloquii%2Bseersuker%2Bdress%2B%2Bboater%2Bhat%2Bplus%2Bsize%2Boutfit.jpg)

##muslin




With a slightly ‚Äúcrinkled‚Äù texture, muslin is casual in nature, and it brings visual interest all on its own. Sure, it may not be ideal for a sleek outfit, but it‚Äôs perfect for a billowy sleeveless dress when it‚Äôs too hot to put anything else on, but you still want it to look ~interesting~.

# Proportions & silhouette 





My personal favorite, playing with proportion and silhouette is a subtle and sophisticated way to create An Outfit if you‚Äôre not into accessorizing or it‚Äôs too hot to pile on the necklaces. Structural and sleek, this type of outfit allows shapes to speak for themselves and become the main event, with minimal other distractions. 





## loose on loose



There is no better season to do loose on loose than summer, especially if you prefer not to show skin. As cute as tight dresses are, this is not the time to pull them out. Instead, a pair of cropped wide leg pants can work surprisingly well with a boxy shirt with billowy sleeves. The silhouette is interesting on its own, you don‚Äôt have fabric touching your skin, and you‚Äôre not getting sunburned. All in all, 10/10 summer outfit.

## tight on loose




That isn‚Äôt to say that we can‚Äôt do tight + loose in hot weather, you just have to be more strategic about it. It‚Äôs still a visually interesting silhouette, but in the summer, the tight element should be the top, paired with a looser skirt or pair of pants. A bodycon tanktop or crop top with a pair of high-waisted linen shorts is as elegant as it is cooling.

## structural/architectural detailing 





Sometimes, a single piece with strong architectural detailing can bring all the pizzazz you need. In recent years, with the ushering in of maximalist tendencies, there‚Äôs been no shortage of interesting structural details on summer clothes. A short, but wonderfully voluminous dress is both a statement and a clever way to stay cool. Same with very wide pants, a long column silhouette, intense pleating on a skirt, or an interesting neckline. Unexpected accessories like very chunky shoes paired with a very short dress or a very small purse with a voluminous outfit can also provide that extra kick.

# Interesting details




Seemingly small details can go a long way in elevating a piece, so don‚Äôt discount the power that beading can have, straps, buckles, or even buttons. Some of these details will work better for evening than daytime, but it entire depends on your style, the type of embellishment, and the occasion. Daytime sequins are acceptable outside of Vegas now, I‚Äôm just saying. 






## embellishment




Simple shapes can still look amazing, if you add a little bling. The addition of sequins, rhinestones, or intricate beading can turn a forgettable dress into something special. The best part is that this can be DIY-ed, especially if you have a dress you‚Äôre a little tired of or that is a tad boring. You can be as restrained or as crazy as you want with your embellishments. Pearl straps, bejeweled necklines, or full sequinned pieces - they‚Äôre always a show-stopper.

## straps



With enough sunscreen, or a disregard for unconventional tan lines, something as simple as strap placement can make an outfit more interesting. Very strappy tops are very in right now, as are tops and dresses with open backs with special detailing, like tie-backs, bows, or cut-outs in different shapes.

## buckles, knots, pleating, buttons





Other distinct visual details that can also be utilitarian also help draw the eye, add some contrast, and zuzh up your outfit. Whether it‚Äôs a simple row of contrasting buttons, some statement hardware in the form of a special belt buckle, or gorgeous pleating, these details can say a lot without trying too hard.

# Accessories


Sometimes, the easiest way to do it is just to add accessories. It requires less fussing, and you don‚Äôt have to think as much about them. The biggest bonus here is that accessories rarely make you hotter, but they can still have a huge visual impact and totally ‚Äúmake‚Äù an outfit. 



## textured/colorful/big or small bag




A bag should never be an afterthought, but that‚Äôs especially important to remember when putting together summer outfits. Because you have fewer elements to play with, each of them becomes more important and ‚Äúweighs‚Äù more in the overall structure of your look. 


A very big or very small bag is a tried and true way to bring the unexpected, but you can also achieve a similar effect if you pick a bag that is colorful, or that‚Äôs textured. Consider giving your black leather bags a rest, and instead, enjoying wicker baskets, wooden bags, braided bags, and other unique textures or shapes. Summer is the time for the novelty bag to shine.

## interesting shoes - size, color, heel shape, embellishments




Of course, shoes are also essential. Not just because you literally cannot create an outfit without them, but because they can also weigh heavily in the balance of your outfit. Luckily for us, statement shoes are in, and there‚Äôs plenty to play with in terms of features. Chunky shoes are du jour, but there are also very strappy shoes out there, interesting heel shapes, high platforms, shiny embellishments, and shockingly neon colors.

## hats 



If you‚Äôve ever wished you could wear hats, but were afraid you‚Äôd look like an asshole, now is your time. You have plausible deniability, hats are not just stylish, but they‚Äôre useful, or even necessary, if you live somewhere where the sun is particularly oppressive. Shout out to Australia, the skin cancer capital of the world. 


A straw hat can complete an outfit or push it towards a certain vibe. Chic Gondolier with a breton tee and black shorts? Add a hat. Jungle Adventurer dressed head to toe in new-wave Banana Republic? Add a hat. Baptist Church Lady-core with a ruffly floral dress? Add a hat.

# Third Piece



The third piece is, of course, a basic ‚Äúrule‚Äù for outfit creation, but hot weather makes it just a little bit more difficult, when even one layer of clothing feels like too much to bear. Thankfully, you can ‚Äúcheat‚Äù and still add your third piece, but without adding extra bulk on top of an outfit you‚Äôre already overheating in. 






## linen blazer




For evenings and A/C environments, a linen blazer is very versatile and makes almost any outfit better. It works great with little dresses, shorts, wide leg linen pants - it flatters elegant outfits and beautifully contrasts more casual ones. You really can‚Äôt go wrong, and you also can‚Äôt overheat.

## vests




A more summer-y version of the blazer, the vest is not just very fashionable at the moment, it‚Äôs also the perfect layering piece. Adding minimal bulk, but maximum visual interest, a vest can be paired with anything, from dresses to shirts & shorts, to wearing it by itself as a top. The vest + shorts or vest + pleated pants combo reigns supreme for the spring/summer season; it‚Äôs sophisticated, a little masculine, and a nice departure from typical summer outfits.

## fanny pack/cross body



Any bag can make a good third piece, as we‚Äôve discussed, but a fanny pack worn crossbody is more visible, in many ways, it‚Äôs very cool, and it can be very flattering. Worn on top of a straighter, looser, or more billowy top or dress, it creates some necessary shaping, while still maintaining the casual vibe. Wear it in a contrasting color or interesting texture for maximum effect.

## maximalist jewelry



Jewelry may be the easy way out, but one cannot deny the effect of a truly big-ass pair of earrings with an otherwise simple outfit. Necklaces, rings, and bracelets are not to be ignored, and can also work beautifully to accent an outfit or your great tan, but earrings have the advantage of not touching your skin and they also bring attention to your face, and look great with your hair up - a must, in hot weather.

https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11m7yxr/updating_an_outdated_wardrobe_part_2_office_wear/","how to add visual interest to summer outfits one question that pops up incredibly often on this sub once high temperatures hit is how to make warm weather wear looks interesting the disconnect seems to occur because for fallwinter dressing there is more texture and more layering to play with so it s easier to create an  outfit  rather than just  clothes  when you re only wearing one layer that becomes more difficult and the outfit you re trying to put together can leave something to be desired as it s plain and stripped back 


but you don t have to layer 3 types of clothes in order to maintain style going into the warmer months warm weather has endless opportunities for fashionable dressing and in the glorious absence of a big coat that covers up all your hard work you re free to show off an outfit that plays with colors proportions textures patterns or interesting accessories 


i know summer is technically on its way out but a lot of us still have at least a month or two of hot weather to go so let s take a look at putting together some cool summer outfits 





 color





perhaps more than anything else warm weather is an excellent opportunity to enjoy color while no one s stopping you from wearing colorful clothes in the winter it s clear that cold weather tends to be a sad mass of black  mostly for practical reasons 


but when the sun is shining and there are no coats covering up your outfit you can bring out the yellows the pinks the greens  and they can be the key to taking your attire from just  clothes  to an  outfit  







 color blocking




color blocking is a tried and true method to add visual interest color in an outfit always brings it up a step but color blocking requires more skill and more attention paid to silhouette as well as color pairings you can opt for colors opposite on the color wheel or just colors that feel right to you  there are no rules as long as you love the result

pop of color




opting for just a pop of color can be a great way to make your outfit more fun but without the difficulty of pairing colors together the easiest way to do it is to add a colorful bag to an otherwise neutral outfit a lavender bag can give a little contrast to a basic white dress and elevate it to an outfit especially if you re also pairing it with a colorful pair of shoes matching shoes are fine but an even more interesting choice is a pair of shoes in a complementary color

 monochrome



probably a lot of us have worn allblack before but how many have tried the same in a different color what is boring and safe in black becomes infinitely more stylish and interesting in a bold color that goes great with a tan think about an all pink outfit and what a statement it makes it s still really easy to put together  you re only using one color  and yet it s anything but boring 






monochrome 1


monochrome 2


monochrome 3





tonal dressing



pairing colors together can be tricky and it s often a barrier of entry to fashion for the regular person but there are easy somewhat prescriptive ways to do it like tonal dressing not quite monochrome tonal dressing is more about picking different shades of the same base color or color palette adjacent colors if you will both a step above monochrome and easier than finding identical shades to match tonal dressing is more visually exciting than a monochromatic outfit while still being a subtle way to do color  






tonal 1


tonal 2

 pattern




perhaps an obvious suggestion pattern pulls an outfit right out of its boring solid color nothingness and gives it purpose it gives it oomph it gives it visual interest where things really get interesting is when you pattern match  or clash but that s a somewhat  advanced  lesson for now even something as simple as choosing a floral skirt instead of a solid colored one can make your clothes an  outfit  




 floral




yes yes florals for spring are not groundbreaking but we have to walk before we can run florals are common and they re easy a very seasonallyappropriate pattern for springsummer it adds a touch of whimsy and femininity to an otherwise simple outfit

 polka dots  stripes




polka dots and stripes are other classic patterns you can t really go wrong with they typically still come in neutral colors for the most part but you can also find them in more fun colors if you don t want to stick to boring black and white

 abstract




then of course we ve got the cooler more modern abstract prints paint splotches random shapes approximations of faces  anything goes why wear a basic white shirt when you can wear an interesting one

 gingham




gingham is a classic summer staple casual and light it s a quintessential  picnic  print black and white gingham is a good neutral option but if you want something more fun any pastel color  white is very summery while still maintaining visual interest 






gingham 1


gingham 2


gingham 3

 pattern clashing




of course the ultimate way to wear pattern is to clash it against more pattern a higher difficulty task but with a big visual reward pattern clashing can make even the most boring basic outfit look elevated

 texture






when you ve not got many pieces to work with for an outfit those pieces have to work much harder to be interesting to stand out to be  worthy  in comes texture an outfit that s cotton from top to bottom is not much of an outfit it s plain flat and boring mixing silk and organza however becomes an event 






 linencotton
linen and cotton are the fabrics of choice for many during the summer it s easy to see why  they keep you cool they feel nice and they re easy to find on the highstreet at decent prices plus they tend to last  if slightly discolored from the sun a good basis that you can add to 




linen cotton 1


linen cotton 2


linen cotton 3




 sheer tulle gauze organza




sheer is having a huge moment and now is the time to take full advantage despite it being mainly synthetic fabrics the thinness sheerness volume and lightweight quality of these fabrics means they can be easily worn during the height of summer without fear of heatstroke beautiful diaphanous and eminently special a sheer element can bring the whimsy you need for a wedding outfit the femininity to a date outfit or that special je n est ce quoi to a simple brunch outfit

 silk




silk is in no way as fanciful as it s touted to be and it has the excellent advantage of being a great lightweight option for hot weather especially if you need something special or formal there s nothing better than silk it looks amazing it s cool and it packs small 





silk 1

 seersucker



a quintessential summer fabric if there ever was one seersucker is great for a variety of clothes since it s so light it allows you to wear more formal or covered up garments such as an elegant seersucker suit that would be hot in any other fabric 




seersucker 1


seersucker 2




muslin




with a slightly  crinkled  texture muslin is casual in nature and it brings visual interest all on its own sure it may not be ideal for a sleek outfit but it s perfect for a billowy sleeveless dress when it s too hot to put anything else on but you still want it to look interesting 




muslin 1


muslin 2


muslin 3






 proportions  silhouette 





my personal favorite playing with proportion and silhouette is a subtle and sophisticated way to create an outfit if you re not into accessorizing or it s too hot to pile on the necklaces structural and sleek this type of outfit allows shapes to speak for themselves and become the main event with minimal other distractions 





 loose on loose



there is no better season to do loose on loose than summer especially if you prefer not to show skin as cute as tight dresses are this is not the time to pull them out instead a pair of cropped wide leg pants can work surprisingly well with a boxy shirt with billowy sleeves the silhouette is interesting on its own you don t have fabric touching your skin and you re not getting sunburned all in all 1010 summer outfit 




loose 1


loose 2


loose 3


loose 4


loose 5




 tight on loose




that isn t to say that we can t do tight  loose in hot weather you just have to be more strategic about it it s still a visually interesting silhouette but in the summer the tight element should be the top paired with a looser skirt or pair of pants a bodycon tanktop or crop top with a pair of highwaisted linen shorts is as elegant as it is cooling




tight 1

 structuralarchitectural detailing 





sometimes a single piece with strong architectural detailing can bring all the pizzazz you need in recent years with the ushering in of maximalist tendencies there s been no shortage of interesting structural details on summer clothes a short but wonderfully voluminous dress is both a statement and a clever way to stay cool same with very wide pants a long column silhouette intense pleating on a skirt or an interesting neckline unexpected accessories like very chunky shoes paired with a very short dress or a very small purse with a voluminous outfit can also provide that extra kick 






structural 1

 interesting details




seemingly small details can go a long way in elevating a piece so don t discount the power that beading can have straps buckles or even buttons some of these details will work better for evening than daytime but it entire depends on your style the type of embellishment and the occasion daytime sequins are acceptable outside of vegas now i m just saying 






 embellishment




simple shapes can still look amazing if you add a little bling the addition of sequins rhinestones or intricate beading can turn a forgettable dress into something special the best part is that this can be diyed especially if you have a dress you re a little tired of or that is a tad boring you can be as restrained or as crazy as you want with your embellishments pearl straps bejeweled necklines or full sequinned pieces  they re always a showstopper 




embellishment 1

 straps



with enough sunscreen or a disregard for unconventional tan lines something as simple as strap placement can make an outfit more interesting very strappy tops are very in right now as are tops and dresses with open backs with special detailing like tiebacks bows or cutouts in different shapes 




straps 1



straps 2


straps 3




 buckles knots pleating buttons





other distinct visual details that can also be utilitarian also help draw the eye add some contrast and zuzh up your outfit whether it s a simple row of contrasting buttons some statement hardware in the form of a special belt buckle or gorgeous pleating these details can say a lot without trying too hard 



details 1

 accessories


sometimes the easiest way to do it is just to add accessories it requires less fussing and you don t have to think as much about them the biggest bonus here is that accessories rarely make you hotter but they can still have a huge visual impact and totally  make  an outfit 



 texturedcolorfulbig or small bag




a bag should never be an afterthought but that s especially important to remember when putting together summer outfits because you have fewer elements to play with each of them becomes more important and  weighs  more in the overall structure of your look 


a very big or very small bag is a tried and true way to bring the unexpected but you can also achieve a similar effect if you pick a bag that is colorful or that s textured consider giving your black leather bags a rest and instead enjoying wicker baskets wooden bags braided bags and other unique textures or shapes summer is the time for the novelty bag to shine

 interesting shoes  size color heel shape embellishments




of course shoes are also essential not just because you literally cannot create an outfit without them but because they can also weigh heavily in the balance of your outfit luckily for us statement shoes are in and there s plenty to play with in terms of features chunky shoes are du jour but there are also very strappy shoes out there interesting heel shapes high platforms shiny embellishments and shockingly neon colors

 hats 



if you ve ever wished you could wear hats but were afraid you d look like an asshole now is your time you have plausible deniability hats are not just stylish but they re useful or even necessary if you live somewhere where the sun is particularly oppressive shout out to australia the skin cancer capital of the world 


a straw hat can complete an outfit or push it towards a certain vibe chic gondolier with a breton tee and black shorts add a hat jungle adventurer dressed head to toe in newwave banana republic add a hat baptist church ladycore with a ruffly floral dress add a hat

hats 3






 third piece



the third piece is of course a basic  rule  for outfit creation but hot weather makes it just a little bit more difficult when even one layer of clothing feels like too much to bear thankfully you can  cheat  and still add your third piece but without adding extra bulk on top of an outfit you re already overheating in 






 linen blazer




for evenings and ac environments a linen blazer is very versatile and makes almost any outfit better it works great with little dresses shorts wide leg linen pants  it flatters elegant outfits and beautifully contrasts more casual ones you really can t go wrong and you also can t overheat 




blazer 1


blazer 2



blazer 3







 vests




a more summery version of the blazer the vest is not just very fashionable at the moment it s also the perfect layering piece adding minimal bulk but maximum visual interest a vest can be paired with anything from dresses to shirts  shorts to wearing it by itself as a top the vest  shorts or vest  pleated pants combo reigns supreme for the springsummer season it s sophisticated a little masculine and a nice departure from typical summer outfits 




vest 1

 fanny packcross body



any bag can make a good third piece as we ve discussed but a fanny pack worn crossbody is more visible in many ways it s very cool and it can be very flattering worn on top of a straighter looser or more billowy top or dress it creates some necessary shaping while still maintaining the casual vibe wear it in a contrasting color or interesting texture for maximum effect 




pack 1

pack 4




 maximalist jewelry



jewelry may be the easy way out but one cannot deny the effect of a truly bigass pair of earrings with an otherwise simple outfit necklaces rings and bracelets are not to be ignored and can also work beautifully to accent an outfit or your great tan but earrings have the advantage of not touching your skin and they also bring attention to your face and look great with your hair up  a must in hot weather

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,"I don‚Äôt love you anymore, Fashion Industry, and this is why.","Dear Fashion Industry,

I‚Äôve fallen out of love with you, and I‚Äôm going to tell you why. First you should know that I‚Äôve loved you for a very long time, since I was a little girl insisting on picking out her own clothes. As a teenager I avidly collected copies of Teen Vogue and pasted pages on my walls. I cared very much about what I wear, and at almost 26 I still do. But lately, you‚Äôve brought me less joy and more frustration and discomfort. The older I‚Äôve become, you see, the harder it is to ignore your ugly side. I‚Äôve read the articles and the expos√©s, and now I know about the cost of fast fashion I can‚Äôt go back to not knowing. I don‚Äôt want to shop at places that exploit adults and children, and that plagiarize independent creators. 

This leads me to my other problem: I can‚Äôt afford not to. I‚Äôm broke, and while I know that‚Äôs not your fault, Fashion Industry, maybe you should care that I‚Äôm broke because a huge portion of my generation is also broke. Really broke actually, and it looks like we are going to be broke for a while. Speaking of my generation, we have also been at the forefront of the rise of social media, of fashion and beauty influencers, and of a perhaps unprecedented level of consumerism. Every day I am blasted with images that tell me what I need to have right now. I see influencers uploading haul after haul of free goods (sent by you, Fashion Industry) or impulse purchases, and then uploading clear-out after clear-out of the same clothes with labels still attached. Inside, I struggle between buying into aspirational envy, feeling dismayed that I can‚Äôt afford to update my own wardrobe so frequently, and being uncomfortable with the huge amounts of waste portrayed. Regardless of which emotion wins, I ultimately end up just feeling depressed.

Even if I ignore trends and aim for a timeless, ethical and high quality wardrobe of ‚Äòinvestment‚Äô pieces, I would still need to have the money to invest in the first place. I‚Äôd like to be able to save a whole year for one or two items of clothing, but the reality is that in that time my clothes wear out, my weight fluctuates, and I need a dress to wear to that family member‚Äôs wedding. So as I see it, I‚Äôm left with only a few options. I can put ethics aside, feign ignorance and shop fast fashion, but Zara charges $70 for a top I know was probably made by a child labourer and that will fall apart in 10 washes. $70 seems like a very high price to pay for a blouse with that kind of baggage: I can‚Äôt afford that in more ways than one. I could shop at second hand retailers, which I have been doing in increasing amounts over the last few years, but that‚Äôs exhausting and I don‚Äôt usually end up with the thing I was hoping to find. The best thrift store I‚Äôve found, the only one selling clothes other than second hand H&M pieces priced just a couple of dollars lower than they retailed for in store, is well over an hour and a half‚Äôs drive away. My other option, then, is to make my own clothes. Last year for my birthday I asked for a sewing machine  with that exact intention. But fabric is expensive, sewing takes time, and a lot of practice is required to result in quality garments that fit well and look good. I‚Äôm still working on this option, but I‚Äôve yet to make a garment good enough to wear. 

So what do I do? So far, a bit of all of these options. Sometimes I blinker my ethics and reach for the fast fashion sale rack in shame. Sometimes I make the drive to that thrift store and cross my fingers I‚Äôll find something there. Sometimes I look on pattern websites and see if I can find modern, relevant patterns that won‚Äôt be too hard to follow. Mostly I just haunt Uniqlo, trying to convince myself that it‚Äôs not *true* fast fashion as its clothes are better quality and still in my price range. 

You might say, Fashion Industry, that I‚Äôm doing a lot of complaining. You might say I should find a well paying job so I can afford ethical, good quality fashion - believe me, that‚Äôs the goal. You might say that all of the above options are doable and I should stop whining and accept my lot. For the most part, I try to do that. This letter, you see, isn‚Äôt born from a desire to *complain*. Instead it‚Äôs born from a desire to *explain*. As I said at the beginning, Fashion Industry, I don‚Äôt really love you anymore and this is why. Clothes, shoes, accessories ‚Äî things that have brought me joy my whole life now come with a lot of other emotions instead. Fashion makes me stressed, makes me anxious, makes me pity myself, makes me envious, makes me wasteful, makes me feel depressed. I can no longer enjoy clothes because I‚Äôm caught in a conflicted whirlwind of ethics and consumerism. 

I‚Äôve loved you my whole life, but I‚Äôve realized I put a lot of time and money and energy into this relationship and don‚Äôt get a whole lot back. Perhaps I‚Äôll learn to love you again, but first I have to change some things about myself. Maybe I‚Äôll monitor my time on Instagram, unfollow the influencers who pull me into their world of consumerism and aspiration. Maybe I‚Äôll get better at sewing and find other thrift stores. Maybe I‚Äôll learn to balance my desire to look and feel good, with my desire to be a conscientious consumer. But even if I change those things about myself, Fashion Industry, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever fully love you again until you make some changes too. 

I really wish I could still love you, but these days you just make me sad.

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,how much are clothes actually supposed to cost?,"If you buy a sweater from Shein, it's horribly made and dirt cheap.

If you buy a sweater from Ralph Lauren it's good quality but horribly overpriced, because you're buying the name, not so much the item.

If you buy a sweater from H&M it's not much better than the one from Shein, but still 2-4 times pricier (and slogans about the items' recycled material are often just greenwashing).

If you buy a 100% etchically made chemical free fair trade hemp sweater, it costs an outrageous amount of money and because its so rare, the shipping to your home country might not exist or costs as much as the original item.

Where can I find the middle ground? The place that sells quality clothes for the money that they are worth without violating human rights in the process? Is the latter, extremely expensive but 100% ethical small business really the only option? Perhaps there's some kind of list detailing how much different items should logically cost to get the most out of the money that you're spending?

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?,"Over the last year, I‚Äôve gotten much more interested in sustainable & ethical clothing and have immersed myself in researching these topics. 

Questions like: is _____ ethical? Is _____ sustainable? Where can I buy affordable but ethical clothing? Plague my google search history. 

As a 24 year old who is finally making a decent salary but has been primarily a fast fashion consumer up until a year or so ago, I want to do and be better. 

But a point I‚Äôve seen made many times while reading countless articles about clothing manufacturing ethics and sustainability is that by definition, fast fashion is bad because it‚Äôs not made to last and is made for mass consumption. Trendy pieces and cheaply made pieces made to last maybe a season or two. 

So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years? 

Obviously the issue is layered and nuanced. Sure maybe I have a fast fashion t shirt that cost me $3 that I‚Äôve gotten three years of wear out of, but obviously a $3 shirt wasn‚Äôt made sustainably or ethically. But is there a point where the trade off of ethics and sustainability becomes worth it? 

Is the ‚Äúfast fashion‚Äù buyer who makes new purchases maybe a few times a year and keeps that clothing for years better or worse than the ‚Äúmid range‚Äù clothing buyer who buys clothing monthly (or maybe even more?) and gets fewer uses out of each article of clothing? 

This topic bothers me because I feel like there‚Äôs no good choice unless you have $$$ to spend on the few brands that are sustainable and ethical. Is Aritzia or J Crew that much better than Forever 21 or Fashion Nova? Is the clothing quality that much better that it warrants a 300%+ price increase? Are their ethics/sustainability practices better?

Even luxury and designer brands have questionable histories, like Chanel. 

It‚Äôs just so frustrating! I feel like in the last year or two in particular there has been a sharp uptick in clothing ‚Äúboutiques‚Äù and online only clothing stores which just muddy the waters further & make the shopping process that much more confusing for the average consumer. 

I‚Äôd love to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this matter! This has been bugging me for forever and no one IRL I know wants to have this conversation.

i d love to hear everyone s thoughts on this matter this has been bugging me for forever and no one irl i know wants to have this conversation

eta i just want to include that for the time being i ve decided to predominantly buy secondhand and have been buying clothes through vinted pretty much exclusively for the last year until i can find other options i am comfortable with",Positive

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,Your guide to shopping The RealReal ‚Äî a hot mess consignment website with some amazing gems.,"(Also posted on r/frugalFemaleFashion)

So you want to pick up some bargain second hand designer items, or maybe you want to shop gently used clothes made of silk, cashmere, or linen for dirt cheap. Certainly you‚Äôd like doing all of this while keeping your consumption habits sustainable and ethical.

Since last spring, one of my favorite sources of second hand goods has been The RealReal. I‚Äôve found [holy grail silk maxi gowns](https://imgur.com/a/miZ7e8M) for as low as $32; [NWT cashmere sweaters](https://cdna.lystit.com/photos/dorothee-schumacher/e6e762e8/dorothee-schumacher--Pullover-O-neck-11.jpeg) retailing for $500 for $45; but I‚Äôve also made plenty of mistakes.¬†

After a many months of experience learning the ins and outs of using this site, I‚Äôd I‚Äôd like to provide a guide on how to score deals and avoid pitfalls ‚Äî something I wish I had found when I first started shopping there. **Most of these tips can be applied to other second hand websites as well,** although most of my experience is with TRR.

Obviously this post isn‚Äôt sponsored (I hope this becomes obvious as I go into problematic aspects of the website). But as someone passionate about the second hand market, I want to provide a tool for people interested in second hand sourcing.

Let‚Äôs dive in.

# Part 1: Ethics and concerns ‚Äî the good, the bad, and the ugly

**THE GOOD**: there is a massive glut of designer clothing floating around people‚Äôs closets, unworn. As we all know, buying second hand is much better for the environment than even purchasing from sustainable brands, as there is zero use of water and natural resources involved in production, and the only waste comes from shipping materials and transportation.

Shifting the bulk of your purchase to the¬† second hand market is the most environmentally friendly way of introducing new items into your closet. There are many nuances to this discussion of course, [and many critiques to thrifting](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.popsci.com/story/environment/thrift-second-hand-shopping-sustainable-ethical/%3famp), but that is a discussion to be had for another time.

The RealReal is aware that this is a big motivator for their customers, and they‚Äôve seemed to embrace it. For example, bags they ship their clothing in are 100% recyclable.¬†

**THE BAD**: Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room ‚Äî The RealReal is notorious for fakes. As they process large quantities of clothes (which allows them to keep prices low), copywriters who write up clothing description in fact do the bulk of the authentication. This is a well-known problem which has been addressed in news articles before, [including one from Forbes](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2019/10/23/if-fake-bags-are-being-sold-on-the-realreal-how-can-the-resale-business-ever-succeed/amp/).¬†

[Employee reviews on Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/The-RealReal-Reviews-E729017.htm) seem to indicate that the company prioritizes quantity over quality in processing items, which also likely contributes to these mistakes.

There is a way to avoid these pitfalls ‚Äî I steer clear of popularly duped items such as bags, logo items, and clothing from the most famous brands (Chanel, Prada, Versace etc). I‚Äôll get into this more later.

**THE UGLY**: There is still labor involved in TRR‚Äôs process ‚Äî not least of which are the people photographing, writing descriptions of, and processing the clothing. So it's still good to keep labor ethics in mind when dealing with this.

I haven't heard a *ton* about TRR, but [they did come under fire at the start of the pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/style/realreal-warehouse-ecommerce-new-jersey.html) for not providing proper safety measures in their warehouses for workers. Yikes.

Employee reviews on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/The-RealReal-Reviews-E729017.htm) and [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/The-Realreal/reviews?ftopic=paybenefits) seem to be a mixed bag.

I should also mention that as items from TRR come from the luxury fashion industry, items reflect some of its inherent problems ‚Äî i.e. **the sizing range SUCKS for plus sized consumers.** Hopefully this will change in the coming years, since I‚Äôve seen many brands expanding their sizing ranges, and I hope this will soon trickle down into consignment sites like TRR! 

**My takeaway?** While it's definitely a tradeoff, the fact that it's sweatshop proof plus sustainable means that sourcing clothing (with keeping tips on avoiding fakes in mind) means that TRR is personally worth it for me.

# Part 2: Items to avoid, and getting over brand blindness

So you get on The RealReal, you look up Versace, you sort low to high -- and *wham bam* there is a Versace skirt staring you in the face for only $12.50. How could you not cop it right away?

So two points here: first of all, don't let brand blindness get the better of you. If you saw that same skirt at H&amp;amp;amp;M, would you actually like it? Does it actually fit your style (and lifestyle)? Will you really wear it? After all, the point of buying designer should be getting items with superior design and materials **that you can actually wear and enjoy** in your life -- so if it's a plain-Jane item, a crazy aspirational piece, or a piece from a big name brand that you don't 100% love, it's not worth it.

Second of all, **remember the whole fakes scandal!** Based on both the news reports and word-of-mouth from employees on Glassdoor, this site's goal is to sell large amounts of clothing quickly, and to do that they keep prices low. To keep prices low, their authentication process is shoddy and clothing is processed quickly.

**SO PLEASE DO NOT BUY CHANEL BAGS OR NEVERFULLS ON HERE!** One of the most popular posts on r/FrugalFemaleFashion is [by a user who got sold a fake Chanel](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/lpokqh/the_real_real_sold_me_a_chanel_bag_with_a_fake/).

This extends to many other things. **Steer clear from items that would be profitable as dupes.** I personally ignore all of the big-name luxury brands: Chanel, Hermes, Versace, Gucci, Prada and the like are no-goes for me. Get these items from a more reputable source (like [Fashionphile](https://www.fashionphile.com/shop/brands/proenza) or something).

Lesser known brands are also in danger of having fakes **when it comes to handbags** \-- I avoid Proenza Schouler (though their clothes tend to be good) and even smaller brands like Coperni and Furla. I guess the bottom line is, **avoid bags and probably jewelry too**. Maybe the folks over at r/RepLadies might know better, but I personally would not risk it.

**Edit:** A helpful user highly recommended checking out r/RepLadies to get a better sense of brands that are counterfeited, which even includes super popular brands in the $200-800 range. Some examples given were Zimmerman, Vince, Isabel Marant, Toteme, Anine Bing, LoveShackFancy, etc.

This leaves me with plenty of brands that aren't really profitable or popular for dupes. Some examples from my recent hauls: this [abstract art-looking silk skirt](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/skirts/robert-rodriguez-silk-mini-skirt-a2q0b) from Robert Rodriguez for $20; or these [silk wide leg pants](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/pants/rebecca-taylor-silk-wide-leg-pants-awjkk) plus [this silk maxi](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/rebecca-taylor-silk-long-dress-au36c) from Rebecca Taylor for $25 each. No one in their right mind would be making fakes of these items, it would take high resources for a limited distribution.

Some other less-hyped brands in my usual rotation that are rarely duped include: A.L.C., Calypso, Derek Lam, Ganni, Lafayette 148, Mara Hoffman, Parker, Sea New York, and Stine Goya. If the brand mostly carries clothing in the $200-$800 range, you're good to go.

# Part 3: How to find cute stuff on TRR

Okay; so you're on TRR, you're here to find cute and sustainable and quality and whatnot clothes... but this site is a labyrinth. Where do you even start?

**Tip 1: find the brands you love and search by them.**

If you already have something in mind, this should be easy. If you don't know anything, it's time to learn about brands.

Look at the brands that Saks and Nordstrom are selling; look at the brands your favorite fashion influencer is tagging; look at the ""new in"" clothes that speaks to you and check out similar items they have that are discounted. I like to check out Rent the Runway (since they mainly represent brands that run for $200-$1500 per item) and search by brands that I like on there.

Once you know which brands best represent your style, searching for specific items and styles while using the low-to-high search function on them is helpful.

If you run into a cool item by an unknown designer, check their other stuff as well!

**Tip 2: filters**

Absolutely use the built-in filters, they will save so much time! You can sort by **size**, **designer,** **clothing item type**, **color, style, dress length, and many other things.**

The **low-to-high** price filter can be super tricky though. Of course most of the discounted items will be the ugly stuff, the not-great-condition stuff, or the unfashionable stuff (hello bandage dresses!). **This filter is therefore best used in combination with other filters**: sorting by color, designer, specific style, or material. Searching ""pants"" from low to high will give you a glut of skinny jeans; searching ""silk wide leg print pants"" from low to high might get you somewhere.

Another idea is **setting a price limit and price floor,** which is super useful for new arrivals or for skipping the (mostly) ugly/boring/bad condition clothing selling for $12.50. For the latter, set a price floor at $20 or $30 or whatever to get into the better stuff more quickly.

**For new arrivals**, pick a category (say, cashmere sweaters) and **only sort by stuff priced at $65 or below**. Mark the stuff you like, cop it immediately, or wait for a markdown. This is how I found this gorgeous lightly worn, originally [$695 cashmere sweater](https://www.shopbop.com/millie-top-rta/vp/v=1/1545258778.htm) for $52.

**Tip 3: keywords in the search engine**

As an addition to the above: add more specific terms in your searches. Familiarize yourself in the ways that clothing can be described, and search by styles you wear. Here are some starters and examples...

Pants: high-rise; elasticated waist; wide-leg; slim fit, flared, etc.

Skirts: A-line; maxi/mini/midi; pencil, etc.

Fibers: silk, cashmere, linen, merino wool, viscose, cotton, etc.

Details: turtleneck, mock neck, strapless, sleeveless, long sleeve, V-neck, crew neck, print, floral, animal print, colorblock, striped etc.

Once you type in all of the more specific keywords, sort low-to-high again.

**Tip 4: Tools on The RealReal**

Make use of both the ""**obsessions**"" (favorited items) and **saved searches**. The first will let you keep track of items you'd be interested in buying if they go on a bigger sale. The second is useful for remembering keywords that are interesting for you, whether it is a new designer you like or a combination of keywords that was helpful.

**Tip 5: new arrivals**

The RealReal posts new items twice a day: at 10am/ 7pm EST.  It's therefore useful to check for items from hot brands (LoveShackFancy, Rixo, and the like) during this time, since a lot of the good stuff will be snatched up right away.

**Tip 6: Item condition**

Once you find something that you love, make sure to check the condition. Unfortunately, TRR will sometimes accept items with stains, so make sure you read carefully. ""Good"" condition is usually not very good. I will buy items in ""very good"" condition if they are described as only having light wear.

Some of the description words can be irritating. A ""discoloration"" usually indicates a stain. Then again I've bought items that were in better condition than the listing; a top described as having ""minor marks at sleeves"" didn't really have visible marks. It's a mixed bag.

**Tip 7: avoid outlet items**

Many luxury brands are known to [sell cheaper, lower quality items in outlets](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3392279) under the same brand name. Unfortunately, the RealReal doesn‚Äôt distinguish between these and the higher quality items from the same brand. 

The truth is that I don‚Äôt have a good guide on how to distinguish the two. Just be aware of the brands that sell in outlets (some include Theory, Ralph Lauren, Coach, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, and Marc Jacobs). Checking material composition is a start ‚Äî is a blazer polyester instead of wool? It might be from an outlet.

Also **be aware of diffusion brands**, which are the [labels that name brands use for their less expensive lines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_line)  (Marc by Marc Jacobs, See by Chlo√©, Michael Michael Kors, Armani Exchange, Lauren Ralph Lauren or Ralph by Ralph Lauren). 

These more affordable lines aren‚Äôt necessarily bad, some are still great quality and use beautiful materials. But you might not want to pay $200 for a Proenza Schouler White Label dress if the original cost $400-$500. 

Some more examples of such lines [can be found in this article.](https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/12/Secondary-Lines-of-Major-Brands:-Luxury-for-Less.html) Wikipedia also [has a massive list of diffusion brands.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_line) Do some research into brands so that you can tell what the diffusion lines vs luxury lines are; for example, [this blog post](https://www.google.com/amp/s/samtalksstyle.com/2020/05/27/a-guide-to-ralph-lauren-clothing-sub-brands-and-diffusion-lines/amp/) discusses the million Ralph Lauren lines and their differences.

What I do is check the material composition (many ‚Äî but not all ‚Äî of these items will be polyester); and then I ask myself if the item is worth the price regardless of the brand. Again, do you like the item because it‚Äôs Marc Jacobs? Or do you ACTUALLY like the item based on the design, material, price, and functionality in your own wardrobe? Diffusion lines can still be a great deal ‚Äî I purchased [this Derek Lam 10 Crosby](https://editorialist.com/p/derek-lam-10-crosby-womens-evan-textured-leopard-sweatergreen-multi/) sweater that is a polyamid/wool/viscose blend for $24 NWT, a great deal for me. 

**Tip 8: Reverse image search**

If you want more information on how the item looks in photographs (or if it's an actual item from the brand), reverse image search is your best friend.

This is especially useful considering that the lighting TRR uses for taking photos can sometimes be deceiving. [This Proenza Schouler sweater](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/knitwear/proenza-schouler-merino-wool-printed-sweater-9xnc4) is looks red and white; but a reverse image search reveals that [it's actually red and baby blue.](https://modesens.com/product/proenza-schouler-superfine-merino-wool-printed-sweater-light-blue-red-12365036/)

Which brings me to my next point...

# Part 4: using Google reverse image search

So you see a cute dress but want to understand how the fit looks on a human model. Or you see a gorgeous sweater but you're wondering about the original price. Or you want to better understand the item‚Äôs colors.

Or you find cute summer pants which sadly **have the fabric composition tag removed**, and you want to check if it's silk, cotton, polyester, or whatnot.

Well fear not, because Google reverse image search is here to help you find original listings and images!

Simply download the Google app; screenshot the coveted item on your phone; tap the camera logo next to the Google search bar; select your photo; and voila, plenty of matches for your item!

There are of course limitations, especially if your item of choice belongs to an older collection, or if it‚Äôs a very plain item (a black skirt). **In these cases you might have to manually type in brand name + keywords**, so pay close attention to the item details and describe it the best you can.

If your item is from a recent enough collection, you might even be able to find it on the website Rent The Runway. Basically this is a clothing rental service, and what‚Äôs great is that users will leave pictures and detailed reviews on how their item fit based on their body type and size regularly worn.

RTR has actually saved me a couple of times. I was eyeing this [funky tie-die dress by Proenza Schouler](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/proenza-schouler-tie-dye-print-midi-length-dress-w-tags-b5vgp), but [the ladies over at RTR](https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/proenza_schouler/tie_dye_knotted_back_maxi?lens=membership) pointed out that the material was super thin and that it felt more like a cover-up than a dress!

# Part 5: does the item fit?

**Don't trust the measurements on the site, they're really bad.** An example: [this size S dress from Stine Goya](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-striped-knee-length-dress-acjzc) is listed as having 33"" bust, 26"" waist, and 40"" hip measurements; [the same exact dress](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-striped-knee-length-dress-b5s3o) is listed as having 34"" bust, 24"" waist, and 48"" hip measurements. WTF?

Luckily with reverse image search (or just keyword search), you can find an [original listing of this specific dress](https://www.aquelarreshop.com/products/stine-goya-baby-striped-mini-dress?variant=28371741442142) which provides a size guide. If you can't find the original listing, looking up the brand's general sizing chart is a great way to go.

If you're really lucky, the item you like will also be listed on Rent The Runway. If you're salivating over this [other Stine Goya dress](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-silk-midi-length-dress-w-tags-ax9jb), you're in luck, since numerous users have [left pictures and reviews on fit and look on the RTR page](https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/stine_goya/hortensia_maxi). Even if your item isn't listed, it can be useful to look through RTR as a way of checking how other similar items from the brand fit -- too large, too small, or true to size. RTR users often leave their measurements (height, weight, body type) for an easy comparison.

**Sometimes you don't get so lucky, and have to play it safe.** Check the fabric composition; is there any stretch or give? Does the bust look like it will actually accommodate you? Is the item forgiving of small measurement differences? How does the item fit the models in the reverse image picture?

I personally avoid jeans or any pants that have a highly body-specific fit; for pants, anything with an elastic waist and flowy design is good. Tops with some stretch tend to be good; skirts are usually safe; dresses as well if they have a more forgiving design.

On the other hand, users in the comments of my OG post have said that they have better or worse luck with very different items than I did. I guess the bottom line is, use your best online shopping common sense, as well as the knowledge you have about your own proportions, to understand what items generally do and don‚Äôt work for you. I strongly recommend having some online shopping experience, especially before committing to a final sale item. **These things should be common sense, but don't let your love of an item overpower the important question of whether an item will work for your body.**

As a last resort, **tailoring is an option, but don't be too idealistic** with what can and can't be tailored!

# Part 6: Scoring a deal -- site credits and sales

**How do sales work?**

So TRR posts new items twice a day; most of these items are **eligible for another 20% off with the coupon code ""REAL20.""**

From here, **items will be knocked down little by little as time goes on** \-- usually first 20%, then 25%, 30%, and so on. Different items will be discounted at different speeds (so usually the NWT items will be discounted more slowly than their ""very good"" counterparts).

Buyer beware: **once an item reaches the 40% mark, it's final sale and you generally cannot return it**. Before then, you can either return it through payed shipping (I think $12ish) or you can return it in person at one of their physical locations.

**Edit:** a helpful user added that if you make a purchase through PayPal, you can use their free return shipping program to get a free $12 return refund!

**Edit:** some comments below added that if you receive an item that was not as described ‚Äî whether in terms of measurements or general description ‚Äî you can often contact customer service and return it. People seem generally happy about this returns process. This is also often the case if you can prove an item is counterfeit.

**Are there any big sales?**

From what I've seen, TRR will have end of season sales. The last one I remember took place in early September (?). At this time, items will temporarily be priced lower, and then go up again in price after the sale. Old items will reach as low as 80%.

**How are items even priced?**

I have no idea how their system works. First of all, be super conscious that sometimes items may be overpriced -- **check the original retail value**!

Second of all, **if you like an item, check the brand's page for similar items**. You might find the exact same item going for much cheaper. As I'm writing this, [this XS Stine Goya dress](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-printed-long-dress-9zzxt) is priced at $86, while [the exact same dress](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-printed-long-dress-azhb9) in the same size and condition is $105

**How to comparison shop?**

Comparison shopping is helpful before committing to a purchase. Check your other favorite second hand sites like Poshmark, Depop, eBay, or ThredUp for a better deal on the same item before you buy.

**Best times of year to shop?**

It's **best to shop for future seasons**. People really do shop seasonally -- currently there is a glut of summer clothing on the website since most people are looking at winter clothing. Plus people who consign are likely getting rid of old clothing at the end of the season.

I think **this affects pricing as well**, which is done by humans. I've noticed some summer dresses had an original price that was 30%-40% more during the summer than what similar or exact same items got now during the fall/winter.

**What about site credits?**

When you make an account on TRR, you get $25 site credit valid for a $50+ purchase. Combining this with the $12 shipping and ""$1 COVID surcharge"" they now have, it **boils down to a $12 discount**. (Note: for y‚Äôall Hawaiians, Alaskans,  Europeans and others, the shipping is unfortunately even pricier).

You can **theoretically make infinite accounts to get as many of these coupons you want** (I am guilty of this). A new account will also give you a 'first look' membership for a month(?), so use that to see all of the exclusive new items that are posted before anyone else sees them.

# Part 7: making your items last

Your order comes in, and now you have cashmere, merino wool, and silk on your hands. Oh crap. How do I even wash these??

I strongly encourage you to look up guides on how to take care of natural fibers (or clothing in general, [even fast fashion](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/q02p1i/a_guide_to_making_your_fast_fashion_clothes_last/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) ). It does take time, there is a learning curve, but once you make it a habit it‚Äôs pretty easy to maintain.

I personally machine wash everything. This makes my life much easier, and machine washing removes the slight ‚Äúvintage smell‚Äù some items will inevitably have. A redditor on r/femaleFashionAdvice put together an invaluable guide to [machine washing clothing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9p1e7g/machine_wash_all_the_things/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

**Some quick tips:**
- machine wash your gentle fibers (wool and silk especially) on cold, with a gentle cycle. Turn everything inside out and put it in laundry bags.
- DO NOT WASH ON HEAT, DO NOT HEAT DRY. This is the best way to destroy your delicates and cause your things to shrink. Air dry your items instead.
- woolens are tricky since wool is hair. Apparently wool has anti-bacterial properties and doesn‚Äôt need to be washed often at all. Many detergents can actually break down wool fibers. Fabric softeners are also a no-go. Use a wool detergent (or baby shampoo like I do), then air dry flat to keep the shape.

So far, all of my purchases have held up well with this process ‚Äî and I‚Äôm talking silk dresses and woolen tops. 

...and that's all folks! I'd love to update based on any suggestions I get from y'all (or if I think something else needs mentioning). In the meantime, happy shopping, go score some closet staples you'll love to wear time and time again!",1637187516.0,"Your guide to shopping The RealReal ‚Äî a hot mess consignment website with some amazing gems. (Also posted on r/frugalFemaleFashion)

So you want to pick up some bargain second hand designer items, or maybe you want to shop gently used clothes made of silk, cashmere, or linen for dirt cheap. Certainly you‚Äôd like doing all of this while keeping your consumption habits sustainable and ethical.

Since last spring, one of my favorite sources of second hand goods has been The RealReal. I‚Äôve found [holy grail silk maxi gowns](https://imgur.com/a/miZ7e8M) for as low as $32; [NWT cashmere sweaters](https://cdna.lystit.com/photos/dorothee-schumacher/e6e762e8/dorothee-schumacher--Pullover-O-neck-11.jpeg) retailing for $500 for $45; but I‚Äôve also made plenty of mistakes.¬†

After a many months of experience learning the ins and outs of using this site, I‚Äôd I‚Äôd like to provide a guide on how to score deals and avoid pitfalls ‚Äî something I wish I had found when I first started shopping there. **Most of these tips can be applied to other second hand websites as well,** although most of my experience is with TRR.

Obviously this post isn‚Äôt sponsored (I hope this becomes obvious as I go into problematic aspects of the website). But as someone passionate about the second hand market, I want to provide a tool for people interested in second hand sourcing.

Let‚Äôs dive in.

# Part 1: Ethics and concerns ‚Äî the good, the bad, and the ugly

**THE GOOD**: there is a massive glut of designer clothing floating around people‚Äôs closets, unworn. As we all know, buying second hand is much better for the environment than even purchasing from sustainable brands, as there is zero use of water and natural resources involved in production, and the only waste comes from shipping materials and transportation.

Shifting the bulk of your purchase to the¬† second hand market is the most environmentally friendly way of introducing new items into your closet. There are many nuances to this discussion of course, [and many critiques to thrifting](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.popsci.com/story/environment/thrift-second-hand-shopping-sustainable-ethical/%3famp), but that is a discussion to be had for another time.

The RealReal is aware that this is a big motivator for their customers, and they‚Äôve seemed to embrace it. For example, bags they ship their clothing in are 100% recyclable.¬†

**THE BAD**: Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room ‚Äî The RealReal is notorious for fakes. As they process large quantities of clothes (which allows them to keep prices low), copywriters who write up clothing description in fact do the bulk of the authentication. This is a well-known problem which has been addressed in news articles before, [including one from Forbes](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2019/10/23/if-fake-bags-are-being-sold-on-the-realreal-how-can-the-resale-business-ever-succeed/amp/).¬†

[Employee reviews on Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/The-RealReal-Reviews-E729017.htm) seem to indicate that the company prioritizes quantity over quality in processing items, which also likely contributes to these mistakes.

There is a way to avoid these pitfalls ‚Äî I steer clear of popularly duped items such as bags, logo items, and clothing from the most famous brands (Chanel, Prada, Versace etc). I‚Äôll get into this more later.

**THE UGLY**: There is still labor involved in TRR‚Äôs process ‚Äî not least of which are the people photographing, writing descriptions of, and processing the clothing. So it's still good to keep labor ethics in mind when dealing with this.

I haven't heard a *ton* about TRR, but [they did come under fire at the start of the pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/style/realreal-warehouse-ecommerce-new-jersey.html) for not providing proper safety measures in their warehouses for workers. Yikes.

Employee reviews on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/The-RealReal-Reviews-E729017.htm) and [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/The-Realreal/reviews?ftopic=paybenefits) seem to be a mixed bag.

I should also mention that as items from TRR come from the luxury fashion industry, items reflect some of its inherent problems ‚Äî i.e. **the sizing range SUCKS for plus sized consumers.** Hopefully this will change in the coming years, since I‚Äôve seen many brands expanding their sizing ranges, and I hope this will soon trickle down into consignment sites like TRR! 

**My takeaway?** While it's definitely a tradeoff, the fact that it's sweatshop proof plus sustainable means that sourcing clothing (with keeping tips on avoiding fakes in mind) means that TRR is personally worth it for me.

# Part 2: Items to avoid, and getting over brand blindness

So you get on The RealReal, you look up Versace, you sort low to high -- and *wham bam* there is a Versace skirt staring you in the face for only $12.50. How could you not cop it right away?

So two points here: first of all, don't let brand blindness get the better of you. If you saw that same skirt at H&amp;amp;amp;M, would you actually like it? Does it actually fit your style (and lifestyle)? Will you really wear it? After all, the point of buying designer should be getting items with superior design and materials **that you can actually wear and enjoy** in your life -- so if it's a plain-Jane item, a crazy aspirational piece, or a piece from a big name brand that you don't 100% love, it's not worth it.

Second of all, **remember the whole fakes scandal!** Based on both the news reports and word-of-mouth from employees on Glassdoor, this site's goal is to sell large amounts of clothing quickly, and to do that they keep prices low. To keep prices low, their authentication process is shoddy and clothing is processed quickly.

**SO PLEASE DO NOT BUY CHANEL BAGS OR NEVERFULLS ON HERE!** One of the most popular posts on r/FrugalFemaleFashion is [by a user who got sold a fake Chanel](https://www.reddit.com/r/FrugalFemaleFashion/comments/lpokqh/the_real_real_sold_me_a_chanel_bag_with_a_fake/).

This extends to many other things. **Steer clear from items that would be profitable as dupes.** I personally ignore all of the big-name luxury brands: Chanel, Hermes, Versace, Gucci, Prada and the like are no-goes for me. Get these items from a more reputable source (like [Fashionphile](https://www.fashionphile.com/shop/brands/proenza) or something).

Lesser known brands are also in danger of having fakes **when it comes to handbags** \-- I avoid Proenza Schouler (though their clothes tend to be good) and even smaller brands like Coperni and Furla. I guess the bottom line is, **avoid bags and probably jewelry too**. Maybe the folks over at r/RepLadies might know better, but I personally would not risk it.

**Edit:** A helpful user highly recommended checking out r/RepLadies to get a better sense of brands that are counterfeited, which even includes super popular brands in the $200-800 range. Some examples given were Zimmerman, Vince, Isabel Marant, Toteme, Anine Bing, LoveShackFancy, etc.

This leaves me with plenty of brands that aren't really profitable or popular for dupes. Some examples from my recent hauls: this [abstract art-looking silk skirt](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/skirts/robert-rodriguez-silk-mini-skirt-a2q0b) from Robert Rodriguez for $20; or these [silk wide leg pants](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/pants/rebecca-taylor-silk-wide-leg-pants-awjkk) plus [this silk maxi](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/rebecca-taylor-silk-long-dress-au36c) from Rebecca Taylor for $25 each. No one in their right mind would be making fakes of these items, it would take high resources for a limited distribution.

Some other less-hyped brands in my usual rotation that are rarely duped include: A.L.C., Calypso, Derek Lam, Ganni, Lafayette 148, Mara Hoffman, Parker, Sea New York, and Stine Goya. If the brand mostly carries clothing in the $200-$800 range, you're good to go.

# Part 3: How to find cute stuff on TRR

Okay; so you're on TRR, you're here to find cute and sustainable and quality and whatnot clothes... but this site is a labyrinth. Where do you even start?

**Tip 1: find the brands you love and search by them.**

If you already have something in mind, this should be easy. If you don't know anything, it's time to learn about brands.

Look at the brands that Saks and Nordstrom are selling; look at the brands your favorite fashion influencer is tagging; look at the ""new in"" clothes that speaks to you and check out similar items they have that are discounted. I like to check out Rent the Runway (since they mainly represent brands that run for $200-$1500 per item) and search by brands that I like on there.

Once you know which brands best represent your style, searching for specific items and styles while using the low-to-high search function on them is helpful.

If you run into a cool item by an unknown designer, check their other stuff as well!

**Tip 2: filters**

Absolutely use the built-in filters, they will save so much time! You can sort by **size**, **designer,** **clothing item type**, **color, style, dress length, and many other things.**

The **low-to-high** price filter can be super tricky though. Of course most of the discounted items will be the ugly stuff, the not-great-condition stuff, or the unfashionable stuff (hello bandage dresses!). **This filter is therefore best used in combination with other filters**: sorting by color, designer, specific style, or material. Searching ""pants"" from low to high will give you a glut of skinny jeans; searching ""silk wide leg print pants"" from low to high might get you somewhere.

Another idea is **setting a price limit and price floor,** which is super useful for new arrivals or for skipping the (mostly) ugly/boring/bad condition clothing selling for $12.50. For the latter, set a price floor at $20 or $30 or whatever to get into the better stuff more quickly.

**For new arrivals**, pick a category (say, cashmere sweaters) and **only sort by stuff priced at $65 or below**. Mark the stuff you like, cop it immediately, or wait for a markdown. This is how I found this gorgeous lightly worn, originally [$695 cashmere sweater](https://www.shopbop.com/millie-top-rta/vp/v=1/1545258778.htm) for $52.

**Tip 3: keywords in the search engine**

As an addition to the above: add more specific terms in your searches. Familiarize yourself in the ways that clothing can be described, and search by styles you wear. Here are some starters and examples...

Pants: high-rise; elasticated waist; wide-leg; slim fit, flared, etc.

Skirts: A-line; maxi/mini/midi; pencil, etc.

Fibers: silk, cashmere, linen, merino wool, viscose, cotton, etc.

Details: turtleneck, mock neck, strapless, sleeveless, long sleeve, V-neck, crew neck, print, floral, animal print, colorblock, striped etc.

Once you type in all of the more specific keywords, sort low-to-high again.

**Tip 4: Tools on The RealReal**

Make use of both the ""**obsessions**"" (favorited items) and **saved searches**. The first will let you keep track of items you'd be interested in buying if they go on a bigger sale. The second is useful for remembering keywords that are interesting for you, whether it is a new designer you like or a combination of keywords that was helpful.

**Tip 5: new arrivals**

The RealReal posts new items twice a day: at 10am/ 7pm EST.  It's therefore useful to check for items from hot brands (LoveShackFancy, Rixo, and the like) during this time, since a lot of the good stuff will be snatched up right away.

**Tip 6: Item condition**

Once you find something that you love, make sure to check the condition. Unfortunately, TRR will sometimes accept items with stains, so make sure you read carefully. ""Good"" condition is usually not very good. I will buy items in ""very good"" condition if they are described as only having light wear.

Some of the description words can be irritating. A ""discoloration"" usually indicates a stain. Then again I've bought items that were in better condition than the listing; a top described as having ""minor marks at sleeves"" didn't really have visible marks. It's a mixed bag.

**Tip 7: avoid outlet items**

Many luxury brands are known to [sell cheaper, lower quality items in outlets](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3392279) under the same brand name. Unfortunately, the RealReal doesn‚Äôt distinguish between these and the higher quality items from the same brand. 

The truth is that I don‚Äôt have a good guide on how to distinguish the two. Just be aware of the brands that sell in outlets (some include Theory, Ralph Lauren, Coach, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, and Marc Jacobs). Checking material composition is a start ‚Äî is a blazer polyester instead of wool? It might be from an outlet.

Also **be aware of diffusion brands**, which are the [labels that name brands use for their less expensive lines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_line)  (Marc by Marc Jacobs, See by Chlo√©, Michael Michael Kors, Armani Exchange, Lauren Ralph Lauren or Ralph by Ralph Lauren). 

These more affordable lines aren‚Äôt necessarily bad, some are still great quality and use beautiful materials. But you might not want to pay $200 for a Proenza Schouler White Label dress if the original cost $400-$500. 

Some more examples of such lines [can be found in this article.](https://www.cnbc.com/2011/12/12/Secondary-Lines-of-Major-Brands:-Luxury-for-Less.html) Wikipedia also [has a massive list of diffusion brands.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_line) Do some research into brands so that you can tell what the diffusion lines vs luxury lines are; for example, [this blog post](https://www.google.com/amp/s/samtalksstyle.com/2020/05/27/a-guide-to-ralph-lauren-clothing-sub-brands-and-diffusion-lines/amp/) discusses the million Ralph Lauren lines and their differences.

What I do is check the material composition (many ‚Äî but not all ‚Äî of these items will be polyester); and then I ask myself if the item is worth the price regardless of the brand. Again, do you like the item because it‚Äôs Marc Jacobs? Or do you ACTUALLY like the item based on the design, material, price, and functionality in your own wardrobe? Diffusion lines can still be a great deal ‚Äî I purchased [this Derek Lam 10 Crosby](https://editorialist.com/p/derek-lam-10-crosby-womens-evan-textured-leopard-sweatergreen-multi/) sweater that is a polyamid/wool/viscose blend for $24 NWT, a great deal for me. 

**Tip 8: Reverse image search**

If you want more information on how the item looks in photographs (or if it's an actual item from the brand), reverse image search is your best friend.

This is especially useful considering that the lighting TRR uses for taking photos can sometimes be deceiving. [This Proenza Schouler sweater](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/knitwear/proenza-schouler-merino-wool-printed-sweater-9xnc4) is looks red and white; but a reverse image search reveals that [it's actually red and baby blue.](https://modesens.com/product/proenza-schouler-superfine-merino-wool-printed-sweater-light-blue-red-12365036/)

Which brings me to my next point...

# Part 4: using Google reverse image search

So you see a cute dress but want to understand how the fit looks on a human model. Or you see a gorgeous sweater but you're wondering about the original price. Or you want to better understand the item‚Äôs colors.

Or you find cute summer pants which sadly **have the fabric composition tag removed**, and you want to check if it's silk, cotton, polyester, or whatnot.

Well fear not, because Google reverse image search is here to help you find original listings and images!

Simply download the Google app; screenshot the coveted item on your phone; tap the camera logo next to the Google search bar; select your photo; and voila, plenty of matches for your item!

There are of course limitations, especially if your item of choice belongs to an older collection, or if it‚Äôs a very plain item (a black skirt). **In these cases you might have to manually type in brand name + keywords**, so pay close attention to the item details and describe it the best you can.

If your item is from a recent enough collection, you might even be able to find it on the website Rent The Runway. Basically this is a clothing rental service, and what‚Äôs great is that users will leave pictures and detailed reviews on how their item fit based on their body type and size regularly worn.

RTR has actually saved me a couple of times. I was eyeing this [funky tie-die dress by Proenza Schouler](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/proenza-schouler-tie-dye-print-midi-length-dress-w-tags-b5vgp), but [the ladies over at RTR](https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/proenza_schouler/tie_dye_knotted_back_maxi?lens=membership) pointed out that the material was super thin and that it felt more like a cover-up than a dress!

# Part 5: does the item fit?

**Don't trust the measurements on the site, they're really bad.** An example: [this size S dress from Stine Goya](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-striped-knee-length-dress-acjzc) is listed as having 33"" bust, 26"" waist, and 40"" hip measurements; [the same exact dress](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-striped-knee-length-dress-b5s3o) is listed as having 34"" bust, 24"" waist, and 48"" hip measurements. WTF?

Luckily with reverse image search (or just keyword search), you can find an [original listing of this specific dress](https://www.aquelarreshop.com/products/stine-goya-baby-striped-mini-dress?variant=28371741442142) which provides a size guide. If you can't find the original listing, looking up the brand's general sizing chart is a great way to go.

If you're really lucky, the item you like will also be listed on Rent The Runway. If you're salivating over this [other Stine Goya dress](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-silk-midi-length-dress-w-tags-ax9jb), you're in luck, since numerous users have [left pictures and reviews on fit and look on the RTR page](https://www.renttherunway.com/shop/designers/stine_goya/hortensia_maxi). Even if your item isn't listed, it can be useful to look through RTR as a way of checking how other similar items from the brand fit -- too large, too small, or true to size. RTR users often leave their measurements (height, weight, body type) for an easy comparison.

**Sometimes you don't get so lucky, and have to play it safe.** Check the fabric composition; is there any stretch or give? Does the bust look like it will actually accommodate you? Is the item forgiving of small measurement differences? How does the item fit the models in the reverse image picture?

I personally avoid jeans or any pants that have a highly body-specific fit; for pants, anything with an elastic waist and flowy design is good. Tops with some stretch tend to be good; skirts are usually safe; dresses as well if they have a more forgiving design.

On the other hand, users in the comments of my OG post have said that they have better or worse luck with very different items than I did. I guess the bottom line is, use your best online shopping common sense, as well as the knowledge you have about your own proportions, to understand what items generally do and don‚Äôt work for you. I strongly recommend having some online shopping experience, especially before committing to a final sale item. **These things should be common sense, but don't let your love of an item overpower the important question of whether an item will work for your body.**

As a last resort, **tailoring is an option, but don't be too idealistic** with what can and can't be tailored!

# Part 6: Scoring a deal -- site credits and sales

**How do sales work?**

So TRR posts new items twice a day; most of these items are **eligible for another 20% off with the coupon code ""REAL20.""**

From here, **items will be knocked down little by little as time goes on** \-- usually first 20%, then 25%, 30%, and so on. Different items will be discounted at different speeds (so usually the NWT items will be discounted more slowly than their ""very good"" counterparts).

Buyer beware: **once an item reaches the 40% mark, it's final sale and you generally cannot return it**. Before then, you can either return it through payed shipping (I think $12ish) or you can return it in person at one of their physical locations.

**Edit:** a helpful user added that if you make a purchase through PayPal, you can use their free return shipping program to get a free $12 return refund!

**Edit:** some comments below added that if you receive an item that was not as described ‚Äî whether in terms of measurements or general description ‚Äî you can often contact customer service and return it. People seem generally happy about this returns process. This is also often the case if you can prove an item is counterfeit.

**Are there any big sales?**

From what I've seen, TRR will have end of season sales. The last one I remember took place in early September (?). At this time, items will temporarily be priced lower, and then go up again in price after the sale. Old items will reach as low as 80%.

**How are items even priced?**

I have no idea how their system works. First of all, be super conscious that sometimes items may be overpriced -- **check the original retail value**!

Second of all, **if you like an item, check the brand's page for similar items**. You might find the exact same item going for much cheaper. As I'm writing this, [this XS Stine Goya dress](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-printed-long-dress-9zzxt) is priced at $86, while [the exact same dress](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/clothing/dresses/stine-goya-printed-long-dress-azhb9) in the same size and condition is $105

**How to comparison shop?**

Comparison shopping is helpful before committing to a purchase. Check your other favorite second hand sites like Poshmark, Depop, eBay, or ThredUp for a better deal on the same item before you buy.

**Best times of year to shop?**

It's **best to shop for future seasons**. People really do shop seasonally -- currently there is a glut of summer clothing on the website since most people are looking at winter clothing. Plus people who consign are likely getting rid of old clothing at the end of the season.

I think **this affects pricing as well**, which is done by humans. I've noticed some summer dresses had an original price that was 30%-40% more during the summer than what similar or exact same items got now during the fall/winter.

**What about site credits?**

When you make an account on TRR, you get $25 site credit valid for a $50+ purchase. Combining this with the $12 shipping and ""$1 COVID surcharge"" they now have, it **boils down to a $12 discount**. (Note: for y‚Äôall Hawaiians, Alaskans,  Europeans and others, the shipping is unfortunately even pricier).

You can **theoretically make infinite accounts to get as many of these coupons you want** (I am guilty of this). A new account will also give you a 'first look' membership for a month(?), so use that to see all of the exclusive new items that are posted before anyone else sees them.

# Part 7: making your items last

Your order comes in, and now you have cashmere, merino wool, and silk on your hands. Oh crap. How do I even wash these??

I strongly encourage you to look up guides on how to take care of natural fibers (or clothing in general, [even fast fashion](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/q02p1i/a_guide_to_making_your_fast_fashion_clothes_last/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) ). It does take time, there is a learning curve, but once you make it a habit it‚Äôs pretty easy to maintain.

I personally machine wash everything. This makes my life much easier, and machine washing removes the slight ‚Äúvintage smell‚Äù some items will inevitably have. A redditor on r/femaleFashionAdvice put together an invaluable guide to [machine washing clothing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9p1e7g/machine_wash_all_the_things/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

**Some quick tips:**
- machine wash your gentle fibers (wool and silk especially) on cold, with a gentle cycle. Turn everything inside out and put it in laundry bags.
- DO NOT WASH ON HEAT, DO NOT HEAT DRY. This is the best way to destroy your delicates and cause your things to shrink. Air dry your items instead.
- woolens are tricky since wool is hair. Apparently wool has anti-bacterial properties and doesn‚Äôt need to be washed often at all. Many detergents can actually break down wool fibers. Fabric softeners are also a no-go. Use a wool detergent (or baby shampoo like I do), then air dry flat to keep the shape.

So far, all of my purchases have held up well with this process ‚Äî and I‚Äôm talking silk dresses and woolen tops. 

...and that's all folks! I'd love to update based on any suggestions I get from y'all (or if I think something else needs mentioning). In the meantime, happy shopping, go score some closet staples you'll love to wear time and time again!","your guide to shopping the realreal   a hot mess consignment website with some amazing gems also posted on rfrugalfemalefashion

so you want to pick up some bargain second hand designer items or maybe you want to shop gently used clothes made of silk cashmere or linen for dirt cheap certainly you d like doing all of this while keeping your consumption habits sustainable and ethical

since last spring one of my favorite sources of second hand goods has been the realreal i ve found holy grail silk maxi gowns for as low as 32 nwt cashmere sweaters retailing for 500 for 45 but i ve also made plenty of mistakes 

after a many months of experience learning the ins and outs of using this site i d i d like to provide a guide on how to score deals and avoid pitfalls   something i wish i had found when i first started shopping there most of these tips can be applied to other second hand websites as well although most of my experience is with trr

obviously this post isn t sponsored i hope this becomes obvious as i go into problematic aspects of the website but as someone passionate about the second hand market i want to provide a tool for people interested in second hand sourcing

let s dive in

 part 1 ethics and concerns   the good the bad and the ugly

the good there is a massive glut of designer clothing floating around people s closets unworn as we all know buying second hand is much better for the environment than even purchasing from sustainable brands as there is zero use of water and natural resources involved in production and the only waste comes from shipping materials and transportation

shifting the bulk of your purchase to the  second hand market is the most environmentally friendly way of introducing new items into your closet there are many nuances to this discussion of course and many critiques to thrifting but that is a discussion to be had for another time

the realreal is aware that this is a big motivator for their customers and they ve seemed to embrace it for example bags they ship their clothing in are 100 recyclable 

the bad let s address the elephant in the room   the realreal is notorious for fakes as they process large quantities of clothes which allows them to keep prices low copywriters who write up clothing description in fact do the bulk of the authentication this is a wellknown problem which has been addressed in news articles before including one from forbes 

employee reviews on glassdoor seem to indicate that the company prioritizes quantity over quality in processing items which also likely contributes to these mistakes

there is a way to avoid these pitfalls   i steer clear of popularly duped items such as bags logo items and clothing from the most famous brands chanel prada versace etc i ll get into this more later

the ugly there is still labor involved in trr s process   not least of which are the people photographing writing descriptions of and processing the clothing so its still good to keep labor ethics in mind when dealing with this

i havent heard a ton about trr but they did come under fire at the start of the pandemic for not providing proper safety measures in their warehouses for workers yikes

employee reviews on glassdoor and indeed seem to be a mixed bag

i should also mention that as items from trr come from the luxury fashion industry items reflect some of its inherent problems   ie the sizing range sucks for plus sized consumers hopefully this will change in the coming years since i ve seen many brands expanding their sizing ranges and i hope this will soon trickle down into consignment sites like trr 

my takeaway while its definitely a tradeoff the fact that its sweatshop proof plus sustainable means that sourcing clothing with keeping tips on avoiding fakes in mind means that trr is personally worth it for me

 part 2 items to avoid and getting over brand blindness

so you get on the realreal you look up versace you sort low to high  and wham bam there is a versace skirt staring you in the face for only 1250 how could you not cop it right away

so two points here first of all dont let brand blindness get the better of you if you saw that same skirt at hampampampm would you actually like it does it actually fit your style and lifestyle will you really wear it after all the point of buying designer should be getting items with superior design and materials that you can actually wear and enjoy in your life  so if its a plainjane item a crazy aspirational piece or a piece from a big name brand that you dont 100 love its not worth it

second of all remember the whole fakes scandal based on both the news reports and wordofmouth from employees on glassdoor this sites goal is to sell large amounts of clothing quickly and to do that they keep prices low to keep prices low their authentication process is shoddy and clothing is processed quickly

so please do not buy chanel bags or neverfulls on here one of the most popular posts on rfrugalfemalefashion is by a user who got sold a fake chanel

this extends to many other things steer clear from items that would be profitable as dupes i personally ignore all of the bigname luxury brands chanel hermes versace gucci prada and the like are nogoes for me get these items from a more reputable source like fashionphile or something

lesser known brands are also in danger of having fakes when it comes to handbags  i avoid proenza schouler though their clothes tend to be good and even smaller brands like coperni and furla i guess the bottom line is avoid bags and probably jewelry too maybe the folks over at rrepladies might know better but i personally would not risk it

edit a helpful user highly recommended checking out rrepladies to get a better sense of brands that are counterfeited which even includes super popular brands in the 200800 range some examples given were zimmerman vince isabel marant toteme anine bing loveshackfancy etc

this leaves me with plenty of brands that arent really profitable or popular for dupes some examples from my recent hauls this abstract artlooking silk skirt from robert rodriguez for 20 or these silk wide leg pants plus this silk maxi from rebecca taylor for 25 each no one in their right mind would be making fakes of these items it would take high resources for a limited distribution

some other lesshyped brands in my usual rotation that are rarely duped include alc calypso derek lam ganni lafayette 148 mara hoffman parker sea new york and stine goya if the brand mostly carries clothing in the 200800 range youre good to go

 part 3 how to find cute stuff on trr

okay so youre on trr youre here to find cute and sustainable and quality and whatnot clothes but this site is a labyrinth where do you even start

tip 1 find the brands you love and search by them

if you already have something in mind this should be easy if you dont know anything its time to learn about brands

look at the brands that saks and nordstrom are selling look at the brands your favorite fashion influencer is tagging look at the new in clothes that speaks to you and check out similar items they have that are discounted i like to check out rent the runway since they mainly represent brands that run for 2001500 per item and search by brands that i like on there

once you know which brands best represent your style searching for specific items and styles while using the lowtohigh search function on them is helpful

if you run into a cool item by an unknown designer check their other stuff as well

tip 2 filters

absolutely use the builtin filters they will save so much time you can sort by size designer clothing item type color style dress length and many other things

the lowtohigh price filter can be super tricky though of course most of the discounted items will be the ugly stuff the notgreatcondition stuff or the unfashionable stuff hello bandage dresses this filter is therefore best used in combination with other filters sorting by color designer specific style or material searching pants from low to high will give you a glut of skinny jeans searching silk wide leg print pants from low to high might get you somewhere

another idea is setting a price limit and price floor which is super useful for new arrivals or for skipping the mostly uglyboringbad condition clothing selling for 1250 for the latter set a price floor at 20 or 30 or whatever to get into the better stuff more quickly

for new arrivals pick a category say cashmere sweaters and only sort by stuff priced at 65 or below mark the stuff you like cop it immediately or wait for a markdown this is how i found this gorgeous lightly worn originally 695 cashmere sweater for 52

tip 3 keywords in the search engine

as an addition to the above add more specific terms in your searches familiarize yourself in the ways that clothing can be described and search by styles you wear here are some starters and examples

pants highrise elasticated waist wideleg slim fit flared etc

skirts aline maximinimidi pencil etc

fibers silk cashmere linen merino wool viscose cotton etc

details turtleneck mock neck strapless sleeveless long sleeve vneck crew neck print floral animal print colorblock striped etc

once you type in all of the more specific keywords sort lowtohigh again

tip 4 tools on the realreal

make use of both the obsessions favorited items and saved searches the first will let you keep track of items youd be interested in buying if they go on a bigger sale the second is useful for remembering keywords that are interesting for you whether it is a new designer you like or a combination of keywords that was helpful

tip 5 new arrivals

the realreal posts new items twice a day at 10am 7pm est  its therefore useful to check for items from hot brands loveshackfancy rixo and the like during this time since a lot of the good stuff will be snatched up right away

tip 6 item condition

once you find something that you love make sure to check the condition unfortunately trr will sometimes accept items with stains so make sure you read carefully good condition is usually not very good i will buy items in very good condition if they are described as only having light wear

some of the description words can be irritating a discoloration usually indicates a stain then again ive bought items that were in better condition than the listing a top described as having minor marks at sleeves didnt really have visible marks its a mixed bag

tip 7 avoid outlet items

many luxury brands are known to sell cheaper lower quality items in outlets under the same brand name unfortunately the realreal doesn t distinguish between these and the higher quality items from the same brand 

the truth is that i don t have a good guide on how to distinguish the two just be aware of the brands that sell in outlets some include theory ralph lauren coach kate spade michael kors calvin klein and marc jacobs checking material composition is a start   is a blazer polyester instead of wool it might be from an outlet

also be aware of diffusion brands which are the labels that name brands use for their less expensive lines  marc by marc jacobs see by chlo  michael michael kors armani exchange lauren ralph lauren or ralph by ralph lauren 

these more affordable lines aren t necessarily bad some are still great quality and use beautiful materials but you might not want to pay 200 for a proenza schouler white label dress if the original cost 400500 

some more examples of such lines can be found in this article wikipedia also has a massive list of diffusion brands do some research into brands so that you can tell what the diffusion lines vs luxury lines are for example this blog post discusses the million ralph lauren lines and their differences

what i do is check the material composition many   but not all   of these items will be polyester and then i ask myself if the item is worth the price regardless of the brand again do you like the item because it s marc jacobs or do you actually like the item based on the design material price and functionality in your own wardrobe diffusion lines can still be a great deal   i purchased this derek lam 10 crosby sweater that is a polyamidwoolviscose blend for 24 nwt a great deal for me 

tip 8 reverse image search

if you want more information on how the item looks in photographs or if its an actual item from the brand reverse image search is your best friend

this is especially useful considering that the lighting trr uses for taking photos can sometimes be deceiving this proenza schouler sweater is looks red and white but a reverse image search reveals that its actually red and baby blue

which brings me to my next point

 part 4 using google reverse image search

so you see a cute dress but want to understand how the fit looks on a human model or you see a gorgeous sweater but youre wondering about the original price or you want to better understand the item s colors

or you find cute summer pants which sadly have the fabric composition tag removed and you want to check if its silk cotton polyester or whatnot

well fear not because google reverse image search is here to help you find original listings and images

simply download the google app screenshot the coveted item on your phone tap the camera logo next to the google search bar select your photo and voila plenty of matches for your item

there are of course limitations especially if your item of choice belongs to an older collection or if it s a very plain item a black skirt in these cases you might have to manually type in brand name  keywords so pay close attention to the item details and describe it the best you can

if your item is from a recent enough collection you might even be able to find it on the website rent the runway basically this is a clothing rental service and what s great is that users will leave pictures and detailed reviews on how their item fit based on their body type and size regularly worn

rtr has actually saved me a couple of times i was eyeing this funky tiedie dress by proenza schouler but the ladies over at rtr pointed out that the material was super thin and that it felt more like a coverup than a dress

 part 5 does the item fit

dont trust the measurements on the site theyre really bad an example this size s dress from stine goya is listed as having 33 bust 26 waist and 40 hip measurements the same exact dress is listed as having 34 bust 24 waist and 48 hip measurements wtf

luckily with reverse image search or just keyword search you can find an original listing of this specific dress which provides a size guide if you cant find the original listing looking up the brands general sizing chart is a great way to go

if youre really lucky the item you like will also be listed on rent the runway if youre salivating over this other stine goya dress youre in luck since numerous users have left pictures and reviews on fit and look on the rtr page even if your item isnt listed it can be useful to look through rtr as a way of checking how other similar items from the brand fit  too large too small or true to size rtr users often leave their measurements height weight body type for an easy comparison

sometimes you dont get so lucky and have to play it safe check the fabric composition is there any stretch or give does the bust look like it will actually accommodate you is the item forgiving of small measurement differences how does the item fit the models in the reverse image picture

i personally avoid jeans or any pants that have a highly bodyspecific fit for pants anything with an elastic waist and flowy design is good tops with some stretch tend to be good skirts are usually safe dresses as well if they have a more forgiving design

on the other hand users in the comments of my og post have said that they have better or worse luck with very different items than i did i guess the bottom line is use your best online shopping common sense as well as the knowledge you have about your own proportions to understand what items generally do and don t work for you i strongly recommend having some online shopping experience especially before committing to a final sale item these things should be common sense but dont let your love of an item overpower the important question of whether an item will work for your body

as a last resort tailoring is an option but dont be too idealistic with what can and cant be tailored

 part 6 scoring a deal  site credits and sales

how do sales work

so trr posts new items twice a day most of these items are eligible for another 20 off with the coupon code real20

from here items will be knocked down little by little as time goes on  usually first 20 then 25 30 and so on different items will be discounted at different speeds so usually the nwt items will be discounted more slowly than their very good counterparts

buyer beware once an item reaches the 40 mark its final sale and you generally cannot return it before then you can either return it through payed shipping i think 12ish or you can return it in person at one of their physical locations

edit a helpful user added that if you make a purchase through paypal you can use their free return shipping program to get a free 12 return refund

edit some comments below added that if you receive an item that was not as described   whether in terms of measurements or general description   you can often contact customer service and return it people seem generally happy about this returns process this is also often the case if you can prove an item is counterfeit

are there any big sales

from what ive seen trr will have end of season sales the last one i remember took place in early september  at this time items will temporarily be priced lower and then go up again in price after the sale old items will reach as low as 80

how are items even priced

i have no idea how their system works first of all be super conscious that sometimes items may be overpriced  check the original retail value

second of all if you like an item check the brands page for similar items you might find the exact same item going for much cheaper as im writing this this xs stine goya dress is priced at 86 while the exact same dress in the same size and condition is 105

how to comparison shop

comparison shopping is helpful before committing to a purchase check your other favorite second hand sites like poshmark depop ebay or thredup for a better deal on the same item before you buy

best times of year to shop

its best to shop for future seasons people really do shop seasonally  currently there is a glut of summer clothing on the website since most people are looking at winter clothing plus people who consign are likely getting rid of old clothing at the end of the season

i think this affects pricing as well which is done by humans ive noticed some summer dresses had an original price that was 3040 more during the summer than what similar or exact same items got now during the fallwinter

what about site credits

when you make an account on trr you get 25 site credit valid for a 50 purchase combining this with the 12 shipping and 1 covid surcharge they now have it boils down to a 12 discount note for y all hawaiians alaskans  europeans and others the shipping is unfortunately even pricier

you can theoretically make infinite accounts to get as many of these coupons you want i am guilty of this a new account will also give you a first look membership for a month so use that to see all of the exclusive new items that are posted before anyone else sees them

 part 7 making your items last

your order comes in and now you have cashmere merino wool and silk on your hands oh crap how do i even wash these

i strongly encourage you to look up guides on how to take care of natural fibers or clothing in general even fast fashion  it does take time there is a learning curve but once you make it a habit it s pretty easy to maintain

i personally machine wash everything this makes my life much easier and machine washing removes the slight  vintage smell  some items will inevitably have a redditor on rfemalefashionadvice put together an invaluable guide to machine washing clothing 

some quick tips
 machine wash your gentle fibers wool and silk especially on cold with a gentle cycle turn everything inside out and put it in laundry bags
 do not wash on heat do not heat dry this is the best way to destroy your delicates and cause your things to shrink air dry your items instead
 woolens are tricky since wool is hair apparently wool has antibacterial properties and doesn t need to be washed often at all many detergents can actually break down wool fibers fabric softeners are also a nogo use a wool detergent or baby shampoo like i do then air dry flat to keep the shape

so far all of my purchases have held up well with this process   and i m talking silk dresses and woolen tops 

and thats all folks id love to update based on any suggestions i get from yall or if i think something else needs mentioning in the meantime happy shopping go score some closet staples youll love to wear time and time again",Positive

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,A good read form Jezebel: The complicated reality of Thrift Store gentrification,"[https://jezebel.com/the-complicated-reality-of-thrift-store-gentrification-1846113458](https://jezebel.com/the-complicated-reality-of-thrift-store-gentrification-1846113458)

The subject of weither thrift has been gentrified comes up here time and time again. Jezebel decided to publish a long read. And it's good (which tends to be rare coming from that site IMO)

Some highlights: 

&#x200B;

>There is little evidence that suggests thrift shop prices are uniformly  rising in response to secondhand clothing trends. Critics of thrift  store gentrification have pointed to the slight increases in Goodwill  valuation guides from 2010 and 2020, but valuation guides are estimated  guidelines for donors to claim a charitable deduction to the IRS, not  hard and fast rules for what store merchandise costs.

&#x200B;

> the idea that used clothing  donations can be radically philanthropic has long been drilled into  Americans even as such thrift stores can barely sell most of the product  they receive on the store floor. But most donated clothing in America  does not go to communities that shop in thrift stores, but [is fed into](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/feb/13/second-hand-clothes-charity-donations-africa)  a massive international re-sale market. At Goodwill, for example,  whatever doesn‚Äôt sell in four to five weeks is then sent to an outlet  store where items are sold by the pound. If it‚Äôs not sold there,  HuffPost [reports](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-does-goodwill-do-with-your-clothes_n_57e06b96e4b0071a6e092352),  it will be auctioned off in a bin, then to a textile recycling  organization like SMART that will likely turn the clothing into wiping  rags or export it overseas, a process which Minter reports costs the  company less than the landfill.

&#x200B;

>Reselling doesn‚Äôt take away merchandise from charity shops that are  overloaded to begin with. Thrift stores have come a long way from their  philanthropic roots and, after decades, have shed their association with  poverty. They also aren‚Äôt, however, an oasis in the fast fashion  market. A popular refrain in discussions of shopping is to cry that  there is ‚Äúno ethical consumption under capitalism.‚Äù But in the case of  thrifting, a more accurate statement might be that there is simply no  consumption that can be anti-capitalist.

&#x200B;

>Buying secondhand clothes is still *buying more* clothes, and  donating old clothes and then replacing them with new ones reinforces  modern ideas about clothing‚Äôs obsolescence, which is exactly what the  fashion industry wants. And the global market for donated secondhand  clothing, in which most donations are [exported from](https://theconversation.com/why-is-used-clothing-popular-across-africa-we-found-out-in-malawi-136438) the USA and the UK to countries in Africa, can have an adverse effect on local economies; in 2015 *The New York Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/world/africa/east-africa-rwanda-used-clothing.html) that Rwanda wanted to reduce the amount of secondhand clothing imported into the country not just to strengthen [local manufacturing](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54164397),  but because ‚Äúwearing hand-me-downs compromises the dignity of its  people.‚Äù The idea that American clothing donations will exclusively  serve local communities in need is a romantic myth, as is the idea that  shopping secondhand is a totally public good in defiance of the fast  fashion circus.

&#x200B;

>But the history of wearing secondhand clothing is more complicated than  rich kids simply play-acting poverty and marginalized identities,  reflecting economic and political anxieties of particular eras.

And so, without further ado‚Ä¶

**HOW TO SURVIVE COLD AND SNOW WITHOUT DYING**

1 **Layer the shit out of everything**

You‚Äôre wearing a t-shirt and a cardigan?  That shit might be good enough for Florida.  It‚Äôs not going to cut it when the cold winds blow in the north.  You better be wearing a cami and a shirt and a sweater under a jacket which is under a coat which is accessorized with a scarf and a hat and mittens‚Ä¶  Basically, check in the mirror before you leave the house.  Do you look like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/Stay-puft-marshmallow-man.jpg)?  No?  GO PUT MORE CLOTHES ON.

2 **‚ÄùBut that doesn‚Äôt look good!‚Äù**

First of all - do you want to die?  No?  Then it‚Äôs totally worth it.  Second of all - cute in the cold is all relative.  It‚Äôs like surfer style.  It‚Äôs its own deal and ‚Äúcute for super cold‚Äù isn‚Äôt the same as ‚Äúcute for not super cold‚Äù.  It‚Äôs like wearing a raincoat when it‚Äôs raining out.  Wearing a less cute one is better than wearing a super cute one and getting wet and cold. At a certain temperature, practical and functional take precedence. The ‚Äòcute‚Äô outfits you see a lot of bloggers wearing are [not realistic](http://www.thecollegeprepster.com/2014/12/ask-blogger-arent-you-cold.html) for the weather. Once the temperature drops, you won‚Äôt be out of place [in a sea of parkas](http://i.imgur.com/wDXpoJW.jpg).

3 **Materials**

Natural materials like wool, silk, down, and fur will often be warmer than their synthetic counterparts. Many retailers offer ethical down options and provide information about how their materials are sourced. Wearing good materials will totally help with keeping warm.

*For a base layer* in super cold, silk or merino wool long underwear are the best shit you can ever own.  It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs amazing.  My mom has had the same silk long underwear for over 30 years.  She really only wears it when snowmobiling or downhill skiing because otherwise it‚Äôs too warm, but even so it‚Äôs lasted really well.  Both silk and merino wool are not only super warm but also super thin so it fits under everything. Often, they will be warmer than their synthetic alternatives at a similar thickness.  Merino wool also has awesome moisture wicking properties so if you do sweat it won‚Äôt make you chilled, and most silks are treated to provide better moisture wicking as well. Merino wool has the added benefit of being naturally antibacterial. If you don‚Äôt want to spend the money on silk or wool long underwear, **Uniqlo Heattech** is a pretty good alternative at a cheaper price.  Keep in mind it‚Äôs super thin, though (so it will fit under clothes) so you can‚Äôt wear it as say - pants.

*For pants* - wool is your best bet if you‚Äôre working in an office and need professional dress pants.  Some people feel that wool is too scratchy even lined, so be aware if your skin is okay with it.  I love wool dress pants in the winter.  So classy and so warm.  Plus a silky lining against your skin tends to feel super nice.  Jeans are notoriously chilly in the winter.  I don‚Äôt know what it is about denim but wind goes straight through.  Jeans with a base layer is super warm and I would recommend it highly but without a base layer is probably going to be too cold.  Thick leggings, ponte pants or fleece lined leggings/tights are really nice and cozy on their own I‚Äôve found unless there‚Äôs a strong wind. 

*For sweaters* - wool is your friend.  Cashmere is ideal, but imo all wools are fantastic.  So warm and wool handles moisture really well so you don‚Äôt end up cold and wet.  Fleece is a terrible coat but a great jacket to wear under a coat.  The wind goes straight through, but if it‚Äôs protected from wind it‚Äôs an excellent insulator.

*As far as outerwear*, wool is great.  Fleece lined gloves and hats are the holy grail.  I had a pair of leather gloves that were fleece lined that were one of my best cold weather items ever.  So warm but light enough to drive in.  If your head and ears get cold fleece lined hats can be found anywhere that sells ski gear.  Coziest beanies on the planet.  :)  Coats in wool, leather (lined, preferably with something thick and fluffy) or down are the best.  Down will be the warmest, but can get pretty wet if you‚Äôre not in a super cold or dry climate, so keep an eye out for ‚Äòwaterproof‚Äô (not water resistant) parkas.  Wool handles wet the best but does have a distinctive wet wool ‚Äòsmell‚Äô.  Leather is a good balance between the two.  Waterproofing is particularly important in gloves and coats since once you‚Äôre wet, you‚Äôre cold.

4 **Wear a long coat with a high collar.**

I thought long coats were ‚Äúuncool‚Äù for a super long time (yay highschool insecurity) but once I started wearing long coats I could never go back.  A midlength coat goes a long way in ensuring that your midsection doesn‚Äôt get exposed to the cold and gives you something warm and dry to sit on and a super long coat ensures that your legs are always warm and that they never have to touch anything cold or wet.  I tried to buy coats that fell no more than a couple inches above my ankle.  It‚Äôs like a column of warmth.  Also, a high collar is so great.  If you buy a peacoat make sure that the collar will button up all the way.  Lots of them only lay open, and that leaves you a big V in the front for cold air to get into.  Also, hoods are pretty dope.

5 **Be aware of footwear.**

One thing I learned is that if your feet are cold, your whole body will be cold.  Wool socks are your friend.  **Smartwool** is really the best imo, but some people prefer **Darn Tough**.  For cheaper alternatives **Costco** has amazing wool socks and I‚Äôve bought good ones in sporting stores too.  I bought some Hue wool socks this year that aren‚Äôt nearly as warm as my heavy-duty sporting good store socks or smartwool but are a good lightweight wool.  Forget other socks exist for the winter.  If you‚Äôre wearing tights, wear wool socks over your tights and then boots.  It‚Äôs the best way.

Wear shoes that keep your feet dry.  One thing with footwear is to be aware of what your life is like.  I wore normal shoes with wool socks all winter in northern WI even though temps dropped as low as -40 pretty regularly simply because I went from my house to my car to where ever I was going and was never outside for more than 20 minutes.  If you‚Äôre outside for longer, you need snow boots.  **Sorel** is one of the best out there as far as snow boots go.  **LL Bean**‚Äôs duck boots tend to be very popular, but the traditional boot will likely need to be layered with thick socks; they also offer insulated versions for winter conditions.  When it comes to snow boots, buy for function not for looks.  You want them to be warm, always, and you do not want to be slipping, sliding, and falling on poorly cleared sidewalks.  If you‚Äôre only outside for short periods normal boots should be fine, just be aware of a couple things.  a) will they keep your feet dry?  b) thick soles get your feet further off the ground keeping them from getting as cold.  c)  you need room for wool socks.  d) will they be stained by road salt?  d) make sure they‚Äôre not slick on ice or you‚Äôll hurt yourself.

6 **Be conscious of cold spots and work toward getting rid of them.**

Different people get cold in different places.  Personally, I found that my neck and chest being exposed always makes me cold.  Turtlenecks and scarves are essential for me keeping warm when it‚Äôs cold out.  I also get super cold feet.  So I make sure to always always wear warm socks.  Keep this in mind.  If you notice you‚Äôre always way colder if you‚Äôre not wearing a hat, wear a hat always.  It will help keep the rest of your body warm.  If you get cold hands, invest in great mittens.  Etc.  

At the end of the day living in the cold is all about being aware of your body.  Realizing where you‚Äôre cold and finding ways to solve that problem.  Style is always important, but when it‚Äôs between frostbite and stylish or not stylish and warm - always choose warm.  Also, like I said.  Watch what the people around you are wearing.  Most cold weather places definitely have a cold weather style that goes along with them.

Much thanks to /u/m1001101 for helping with the guide, adding info and links, and most of all hounding me until I actually did it.  :) ","the beginners guide to not freezing to death so if ffa is to be believed there are women all over the world utterly unprepared for the the bitter cold of winter  questions about how not to turn into a living ice cube are right up there with questions about what to take on vacation  too long ffa has been lacking a guide that tackles the perils of living in a cold climate  now winter is coming and there is still no guide to help you learn how to not freeze when you suddenly find yourself in the great white north  until now  this is not the guidetoendallguides obviously but just my experiences after living my whole life in the frozen tundra know as wisconsin  and so without further ado 

how to survive cold and snow without dying

1 layer the shit out of everything

you re wearing a tshirt and a cardigan  that shit might be good enough for florida  it s not going to cut it when the cold winds blow in the north  you better be wearing a cami and a shirt and a sweater under a jacket which is under a coat which is accessorized with a scarf and a hat and mittens   basically check in the mirror before you leave the house  do you look like this  no  go put more clothes on

2  but that doesn t look good 

first of all  do you want to die  no  then it s totally worth it  second of all  cute in the cold is all relative  it s like surfer style  it s its own deal and  cute for super cold  isn t the same as  cute for not super cold   it s like wearing a raincoat when it s raining out  wearing a less cute one is better than wearing a super cute one and getting wet and cold at a certain temperature practical and functional take precedence the  cute  outfits you see a lot of bloggers wearing are not realistic for the weather once the temperature drops you won t be out of place in a sea of parkas

3 materials

natural materials like wool silk down and fur will often be warmer than their synthetic counterparts many retailers offer ethical down options and provide information about how their materials are sourced wearing good materials will totally help with keeping warm

for a base layer in super cold silk or merino wool long underwear are the best shit you can ever own  it s not cheap but it s amazing  my mom has had the same silk long underwear for over 30 years  she really only wears it when snowmobiling or downhill skiing because otherwise it s too warm but even so it s lasted really well  both silk and merino wool are not only super warm but also super thin so it fits under everything often they will be warmer than their synthetic alternatives at a similar thickness  merino wool also has awesome moisture wicking properties so if you do sweat it won t make you chilled and most silks are treated to provide better moisture wicking as well merino wool has the added benefit of being naturally antibacterial if you don t want to spend the money on silk or wool long underwear uniqlo heattech is a pretty good alternative at a cheaper price  keep in mind it s super thin though so it will fit under clothes so you can t wear it as say  pants

for pants  wool is your best bet if you re working in an office and need professional dress pants  some people feel that wool is too scratchy even lined so be aware if your skin is okay with it  i love wool dress pants in the winter  so classy and so warm  plus a silky lining against your skin tends to feel super nice  jeans are notoriously chilly in the winter  i don t know what it is about denim but wind goes straight through  jeans with a base layer is super warm and i would recommend it highly but without a base layer is probably going to be too cold  thick leggings ponte pants or fleece lined leggingstights are really nice and cozy on their own i ve found unless there s a strong wind 

for sweaters  wool is your friend  cashmere is ideal but imo all wools are fantastic  so warm and wool handles moisture really well so you don t end up cold and wet  fleece is a terrible coat but a great jacket to wear under a coat  the wind goes straight through but if it s protected from wind it s an excellent insulator

as far as outerwear wool is great  fleece lined gloves and hats are the holy grail  i had a pair of leather gloves that were fleece lined that were one of my best cold weather items ever  so warm but light enough to drive in  if your head and ears get cold fleece lined hats can be found anywhere that sells ski gear  coziest beanies on the planet    coats in wool leather lined preferably with something thick and fluffy or down are the best  down will be the warmest but can get pretty wet if you re not in a super cold or dry climate so keep an eye out for  waterproof  not water resistant parkas  wool handles wet the best but does have a distinctive wet wool  smell   leather is a good balance between the two  waterproofing is particularly important in gloves and coats since once you re wet you re cold

4 wear a long coat with a high collar

i thought long coats were  uncool  for a super long time yay highschool insecurity but once i started wearing long coats i could never go back  a midlength coat goes a long way in ensuring that your midsection doesn t get exposed to the cold and gives you something warm and dry to sit on and a super long coat ensures that your legs are always warm and that they never have to touch anything cold or wet  i tried to buy coats that fell no more than a couple inches above my ankle  it s like a column of warmth  also a high collar is so great  if you buy a peacoat make sure that the collar will button up all the way  lots of them only lay open and that leaves you a big v in the front for cold air to get into  also hoods are pretty dope

5 be aware of footwear

one thing i learned is that if your feet are cold your whole body will be cold  wool socks are your friend  smartwool is really the best imo but some people prefer darn tough  for cheaper alternatives costco has amazing wool socks and i ve bought good ones in sporting stores too  i bought some hue wool socks this year that aren t nearly as warm as my heavyduty sporting good store socks or smartwool but are a good lightweight wool  forget other socks exist for the winter  if you re wearing tights wear wool socks over your tights and then boots  it s the best way

wear shoes that keep your feet dry  one thing with footwear is to be aware of what your life is like  i wore normal shoes with wool socks all winter in northern wi even though temps dropped as low as 40 pretty regularly simply because i went from my house to my car to where ever i was going and was never outside for more than 20 minutes  if you re outside for longer you need snow boots  sorel is one of the best out there as far as snow boots go  ll bean s duck boots tend to be very popular but the traditional boot will likely need to be layered with thick socks they also offer insulated versions for winter conditions  when it comes to snow boots buy for function not for looks  you want them to be warm always and you do not want to be slipping sliding and falling on poorly cleared sidewalks  if you re only outside for short periods normal boots should be fine just be aware of a couple things  a will they keep your feet dry  b thick soles get your feet further off the ground keeping them from getting as cold  c  you need room for wool socks  d will they be stained by road salt  d make sure they re not slick on ice or you ll hurt yourself

6 be conscious of cold spots and work toward getting rid of them

different people get cold in different places  personally i found that my neck and chest being exposed always makes me cold  turtlenecks and scarves are essential for me keeping warm when it s cold out  i also get super cold feet  so i make sure to always always wear warm socks  keep this in mind  if you notice you re always way colder if you re not wearing a hat wear a hat always  it will help keep the rest of your body warm  if you get cold hands invest in great mittens  etc  

at the end of the day living in the cold is all about being aware of your body  realizing where you re cold and finding ways to solve that problem  style is always important but when it s between frostbite and stylish or not stylish and warm  always choose warm  also like i said  watch what the people around you are wearing  most cold weather places definitely have a cold weather style that goes along with them

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,What trends do you predict for the 2020s?,"I‚Äôm sure this has been asked before, but a search didn‚Äôt show anything in the last year, so I thought it was worth asking again. 

All the articles are saying it‚Äôll be early 2000s revival, since we‚Äôve gone through a 90s resurgence. I really hope not. Not a fan of low rise jeans.

Here are my thoughts. (I am nowhere close to an expert, would love to hear opposing views!):

- a continued rise in ethical fashion, either with more eco friendly fabrics or a general push to buy less or buy secondhand

- increase in maximalist and over the top silhouettes and styles. 

This might just be my personal hope, sparked from Villanelle‚Äôs outfits on Killing Eve. But right now, there are a lot of more basic/classic (Everlane, etc.) or form fitting (Kardashians) looks in neutral colors in style, and I think we‚Äôll embrace more playful and interesting silhouettes as a reaction. We have already been seeing a lot of puff sleeves, wide legged pants, patterns, power suits this past year.

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,Does anyone else prefer ‚Äúcheap‚Äù clothes?,"*cheap in quotations above because I know it‚Äôs all relative

As I‚Äôve gotten older, gotten into my groove with my personal style, and as I‚Äôve started to make more money, I‚Äôve tried buying more expensive clothing with the idea of having ‚Äúfewer but better‚Äù items...but I just can‚Äôt help coming back to my old, affordable (for me) standbys. I either don‚Äôt like the items as much, or I don‚Äôt notice a discernible difference in quality to where I think it‚Äôs a good value for my money. I‚Äôm also pretty much exclusively shopping online right now due to the pandemic, so it‚Äôs harder to tell if an item is really worth the higher price tag without seeing the quality in person, being able to try on, etc. 

For example, I wanted to invest in a good pair of jeans recently, and after reading lots of reviews, carefully taking my measurements, really thinking about my decision...I bought a new pair of jeans from GRLFRND for about $100 on sale. I picked a pair of 100% cotton jeans with the idea of ‚Äúfewer but better‚Äù/‚Äúbuy it for life‚Äù in mind, but when I got these jeans in the mail & tried them on...I hated them. They technically ‚Äúfit‚Äù but they were so uncomfortable and unflattering. I guess these are the kinds of jeans I need to ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm a new mom and I need my clothes to be comfy right away. So back to my American Eagle jeans I go. 

I‚Äôm still trying to buy less overall and buy more ‚Äúclassic‚Äù pieces that I‚Äôll get lots of wears out of, but I guess I just have cheap taste? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I also want to add a few asides:
-I‚Äôve noticed that brands which I use to think of as ‚Äúnicer‚Äù/‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù from which I could previously only afford heavily discounted items have gone wayyy down in quality over the years. I have a few old items from The Gap and J Crew which I purchased over 10 years ago that still hold up nicely, that are well-stitched, made of high-quality fabric, etc... the last time I got new items from these stores I was disappointed to find they pretty much felt like Forever 21 quality to me. I‚Äôm personally bummed because I can finally afford whatever I want from these stores but the quality has gone downhill. 
-Buying from ‚Äúethical‚Äù companies also seems impossible because apparently they‚Äôre all problematic? Like all the recent stuff coming out about how bad Everlane, Reformation, and Los Angeles Apparel are, among others. 

My discussion questions:
Does anyone else prefer cheaper clothes? 

What‚Äôs your favorite ‚Äúcheap‚Äù brand? Mine is American Eagle lol

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,Recent article on Uighur slave labor in clothing manufacturing,"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/12/11/cotton-china-uighur-labor-xinjiang-new-slavery/

Brands mentioned in the article as complicit in the subjugation of the Uighur people in China include Adidas, Uniqlo, and H&amp;M. I find this especially troubling because, while some brands like Uniqlo straight up advertise cotton products as coming from Xinjiang, implying that they come from the forced labor factories there, others lie and pretend they don‚Äôt know slave labor is involved. 

Aside from the horrifying treatment these people are facing, they are also terrorized and/or brainwashed into pretending it isn‚Äôt happening or that it isn‚Äôt a problem (see the bit about staged street scenes where Uighur are literally just pretending to walk around like everything is fine) and that gives companies that want to deny the abuse more plausible deniability. Because the Uighur laborers are punished for speaking candidly about the situation, of course an audit will find no one admits to it being slave labor. 

I know Uniqlo especially is a brand FFA likes (I like it too) so I thought this would be a good place to discuss this. It‚Äôs just very insidious, and it really seems like you have to be quite sharp eyed to the origins of clothing if you don‚Äôt want to contribute to human rights violations in the fashion industry. Maybe I‚Äôve been too naive.

Edit: I was talking to my sister about this issue this morning and she found the ethics and sustainability certification group that Land‚Äôs End partners with: https://www.bluesign.com/en This could be a good resource for finding ethical brands, although they list Adidas as a partner so I‚Äôm not sure how trustworthy their certification is.

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,Online shopping in Canada guide,"Hey all my fellow Canadians,

I stumbled upon [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5qht81/online_shopping_in_canada_guide/) in our male sub counterpart, and figured we should have one here as well. The idea of the guide is to help Canadians find new stores to shop at without having to worry about duties and the exchange rate, though I'm sure Americans can probably find some good deals especially with the current exchange rate.

I also wanted to share this [price tracker](https://joinplugged.ca/) \- it lets you save items from a handful of these stores and notifies you when it goes on sale. Check it out, I hope some of you will find it useful!

I added my personal list of stores, along with the comments from these old threads ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/41roml/fellow_canadians_favourite_canadian_online/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/agymqk/canadian_ladies_fave_online_shopping_while/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3ekyt2/canadian_ladies_what_sites_do_you_use_for_online/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/8dxggf/online_clothing_retailers_for_canadians/)), and my OCD brain thought compiling the comments into a list here would be useful to some people

I stumbled upon [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5qht81/online_shopping_in_canada_guide/) in our male sub counterpart, and figured we should have one here as well. The idea of the guide is to help Canadians find new stores to shop at without having to worry about duties and the exchange rate, though I'm sure Americans can probably find some good deals especially with the current exchange rate.

I also wanted to share this [price tracker](https://joinplugged.ca/) \- it lets you save items from a handful of these stores and notifies you when it goes on sale. Check it out, I hope some of you will find it useful!

I added my personal list of stores, along with the comments from these old threads ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/41roml/fellow_canadians_favourite_canadian_online/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/agymqk/canadian_ladies_fave_online_shopping_while/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/3ekyt2/canadian_ladies_what_sites_do_you_use_for_online/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/8dxggf/online_clothing_retailers_for_canadians/)), and my OCD brain thought compiling the comments into a list here would be useful to some people

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,I have heard that fast fashion is unethical due to the poor conditions of the workers.

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,"Reformation clothing ""Sustainably made in China""?","Hey guys,

So I was browsing the Reformation website, checking out a skirt and I noticed that it said ""Sustainably made in China"" in the ""Sustainability impact"" part of the description. I then saw that other items of clothing (dresses, etc) also said ""Sustainably made in China.""

Now... Is Reformation outsourcing their production? Supposedly their brand (at least in the beginning) has their own factory where seamstresses make the clothing, etc.

I was trying to find info on this and saw a post here about their racist work environment and the ""apology"" from their founder/owner.

All of this really breaks my heart because if Reformation is now making their clothing in China, are those people *truly* being payed fairly for their work? How are their work conditions?

It also makes me question their ""sustainability"", shipping clothing from China to the US and then to their customers?

This just made me question their whole brand and company, and I get the feeling that they ""sold"" their ""ideals"" for profit... Now that the brand is more popular, they probably have a ton of orders and wanted to make even more profit so they are outsourcing (or fully producing) their clothing in China.

Obviously there's nothing wrong with producing in other countries, ~~but a brand that supposedly has the ideals and morals that they have, shouldn't do that.~~ Edit 4: To clarify, what I meant by what I said here was: When I first discovered Reformation a few years ago, one of their main selling points was the fact that their clothing was produced in their local LA factory. They showed that as something they took high pride in.

For that reason only, is why I thought it was weird that they are now outsourcing, considering they had the whole ""sustainable and **locally made**"" ""label"" **as part of their brand** ***identity***, just like Lush has their ""handmade"" label behind their brand identity.

From a marketing standpoint, what a brand claims as their ""identity"" is very important, which again, is why in this ***specific*** **situation regarding Reformation**, it rose red flags in my mind.

Especially because we all now how factories can easily cover up inhumane treatment of workers, etc etc etc, for whenever they have someone coming over/an ""inspection"", and then return to ""normal.""

Edit 5: Regarding this, u/MissPandaSpark was able to put what I meant into words better than I could:

>""The general idea of ‚Äúmade in the same country‚Äù probably relates to better quality control because they are speaking the same language, have the same cultural values, and are closer for frequent factory check ups, but outsourced items can still be well made or else thousands of brands wouldn‚Äôt have the reputation they have now.""

I'm extremely aware that there's shitty factories and shitty treatment of workers in every country, all around the world.

~~Plus, they are having their clothing made in China but still have their clothing at a premium price?~~

~~Assuming that those people aren't payed as highly as someone in their US factory would be payed, it makes no sense for them to keep those prices (again, I know that if that is happening is because they only care about profit). I'm not going to buy a skirt for xxx$ if it is made in China by workers not getting fair conditions and wages, for that premium price I would just rather buy local and/or something similar, a smaller brand,...~~

Edit 6:  \[Copying this from a reply I already did\] I don't mind, and actually, I ***want*** to pay more for products because brands are paying their workers liveable wages, and providing them with safe and healthy working conditions/environments, plus being sustainable and doing their best to minimise their environmental impact. That's what I meant by what I said here in this bit.

I was trying to address the fact that companies ""greenwash"" or in this case, ""ethicalwash"" their brand and products, sell them for a higher price but then aren't doing what they are saying they are doing. Does that make sense? I don't know if I'm being able to convey what I mean since I see now that what I said was misread and misinterpreted. Like a user has mentioned, supposedly, Reformation dresses cost them 10$ to make but they then mark it up to the xxx$ price tag and spent the money with influencers (?). I don't know if that's true or not, but regardless of whether it is or not, it gives an example that *may* show that a brand, probably isn't abiding by the values that they say their brand has, which was my whole point in the first place.

\-------------------

Edit: Just finished reading the post from their ex-employee talking about their discrimination and it makes me sick to my stomach. One thing is for sure, I'm not going to be supporting their brand. Does anyone have any good *actual* sustainable and ethical brands alternatives? Preferably European brands since I'm from Europe.

**Edit 2: I want to share this quote with all the lovely people that replied and are commenting on this post, but instead of spamming the comments I'm going to add it here!**

**Which is a quote I refer back to whenever I feel frustrated or sad with these topics:**

# ""You can't do all the good the world needs, but the world needs all the good you can do!""

Edit 3: Oh and I also just want to say, A HUGE THANK YOU to all of you who are sharing and commenting with information that is relevant to these topics! I'm learning more than what I knew, from you and that's exactly the reason why I decided to post about this, so I could be more informed! So thank you for sharing your knowledge!

\-------------------

Edit 7: I just want to say a big ""thank you"" to the people who also respectfully shared their views and opinions, in regards to the interpretation that what I said was racist and showed prejudice against products been made in China (or any other Asian country for that matter), and that made me aware that the way I wrote my post could be interpreted in that way.

I apologise to anyone who was hurt by my words and post, that wasn't the point of the post, like I said. I've also admitted in some of my replies, that I'm now aware that the negative connotation that has accompanied labels like ""made in China"", that I personally heard while growing up, and the fact that we, westerners, are always seeing other countries, mainly Asian and African ones, through stereotypes that keep being perpetuated, and not from the actual reality of those countries, clouded my judgement and the way I expressed myself, without me being aware and without me sharing that prejudice.

Now, as an adult, I clearly know that every country has good and bad factories, good and bad practices, good and bad treatment of people/workers, the list goes on. Once again, I appreciate everyone that brought that up, as now I'm more aware of prejudice I wasn't aware I had internalised.

With that said, I can't *not*\-comment on how some people are choosing to be disrespectful to me, to downvote a lot of comments where I clearly, and respectfully, am giving reason to the people who pointed all of this out, and how my discourse wasn't up to par to my actual views on all of these topics. I'm not going to develop this further, because this is the internet and I already know people will claim I'm doing x, y or z, or whatever crazy thing they want to assume, so that's fine. I know who I am, what I stand for, what are my beliefs, what I was focused on in regards to this post, I was respectful to everyone, and I'm now aware of how my post showed prejudice, even if that wasn't the case or the intention, it still did that, and I apologise.

*‚ÄúDarkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.‚Äù*

Thank you all, hope you have an amazing day!

\-------------------

Edit 8: Excluding my reasons for making this post, I can now further see that my post was offensive, prejudiced and racist by the fact that the way I expressed myself, how my words were conveyed, was implying that a product, in this case clothing pieces, ""can't be made sustainably and ethically in China"", when that isn't true at all, and every country has factories producing things sustainably and ethically, just like every country has factories producing things not sustainably and not ethically.

**Which is a quote I refer back to whenever I feel frustrated or sad with these topics:**

# ""You can't do all the good the world needs, but the world needs all the good you can do!""

Edit 3: Oh and I also just want to say, A HUGE THANK YOU to all of you who are sharing and commenting with information that is relevant to these topics! I'm learning more than what I knew, from you and that's exactly the reason why I decided to post about this, so I could be more informed! So thank you for sharing your knowledge!

\-------------------

Edit 7: I just want to say a big ""thank you"" to the people who also respectfully shared their views and opinions, in regards to the interpretation that what I said was racist and showed prejudice against products been made in China (or any other Asian country for that matter), and that made me aware that the way I wrote my post could be interpreted in that way.

I apologise to anyone who was hurt by my words and post, that wasn't the point of the post, like I said. I've also admitted in some of my replies, that I'm now aware that the negative connotation that has accompanied labels like ""made in China"", that I personally heard while growing up, and the fact that we, westerners, are always seeing other countries, mainly Asian and African ones, through stereotypes that keep being perpetuated, and not from the actual reality of those countries, clouded my judgement and the way I expressed myself, without me being aware and without me sharing that prejudice.

Now, as an adult, I clearly know that every country has good and bad factories, good and bad practices, good and bad treatment of people/workers, the list goes on. Once again, I appreciate everyone that brought that up, as now I'm more aware of prejudice I wasn't aware I had internalised.

With that said, I can't *not*\-comment on how some people are choosing to be disrespectful to me, to downvote a lot of comments where I clearly, and respectfully, am giving reason to the people who pointed all of this out, and how my discourse wasn't up to par to my actual views on all of these topics. I'm not going to develop this further, because this is the internet and I already know people will claim I'm doing x, y or z, or whatever crazy thing they want to assume, so that's fine. I know who I am, what I stand for, what are my beliefs, what I was focused on in regards to this post, I was respectful to everyone, and I'm now aware of how my post showed prejudice, even if that wasn't the case or the intention, it still did that, and I apologise.

Thank you all, hope you have an amazing day!

Edit 8: Excluding my reasons for making this post, I can now further see that my post was offensive, prejudiced and racist by the fact that the way I expressed myself, how my words were conveyed, was implying that a product, in this case clothing pieces, ""can't be made sustainably and ethically in China"", when that isn't true at all, and every country has factories producing things sustainably and ethically, just like every country has factories producing things not sustainably and not ethically. Once again, I deeply apologise, that isn't my personal view, feelings, or beliefs, at all.","reformation clothing sustainably made in china hey guys

so i was browsing the reformation website checking out a skirt and i noticed that it said sustainably made in china in the sustainability impact part of the description i then saw that other items of clothing dresses etc also said sustainably made in china

now is reformation outsourcing their production supposedly their brand at least in the beginning has their own factory where seamstresses make the clothing etc

i was trying to find info on this and saw a post here about their racist work environment and the apology from their founderowner

all of this really breaks my heart because if reformation is now making their clothing in china are those people truly being payed fairly for their work how are their work conditions

it also makes me question their sustainability shipping clothing from china to the us and then to their customers

this just made me question their whole brand and company and i get the feeling that they sold their ideals for profit now that the brand is more popular they probably have a ton of orders and wanted to make even more profit so they are outsourcing or fully producing their clothing in china

obviously theres nothing wrong with producing in other countries but a brand that supposedly has the ideals and morals that they have shouldnt do that edit 4 to clarify what i meant by what i said here was when i first discovered reformation a few years ago one of their main selling points was the fact that their clothing was produced in their local la factory they showed that as something they took high pride in

for that reason only is why i thought it was weird that they are now outsourcing considering they had the whole sustainable and locally made label as part of their brand identity just like lush has their handmade label behind their brand identity

from a marketing standpoint what a brand claims as their identity is very important which again is why in this specific situation regarding reformation it rose red flags in my mind

especially because we all now how factories can easily cover up inhumane treatment of workers etc etc etc for whenever they have someone coming overan inspection and then return to normal

edit 5 regarding this umisspandaspark was able to put what i meant into words better than i could

the general idea of  made in the same country  probably relates to better quality control because they are speaking the same language have the same cultural values and are closer for frequent factory check ups but outsourced items can still be well made or else thousands of brands wouldn t have the reputation they have now

im extremely aware that theres shitty factories and shitty treatment of workers in every country all around the world

plus they are having their clothing made in china but still have their clothing at a premium price

assuming that those people arent payed as highly as someone in their us factory would be payed it makes no sense for them to keep those prices again i know that if that is happening is because they only care about profit im not going to buy a skirt for xxx if it is made in china by workers not getting fair conditions and wages for that premium price i would just rather buy local andor something similar a smaller brand

edit 6  copying this from a reply i already did i dont mind and actually i want to pay more for products because brands are paying their workers liveable wages and providing them with safe and healthy working conditionsenvironments plus being sustainable and doing their best to minimise their environmental impact thats what i meant by what i said here in this bit

i was trying to address the fact that companies greenwash or in this case ethicalwash their brand and products sell them for a higher price but then arent doing what they are saying they are doing does that make sense i dont know if im being able to convey what i mean since i see now that what i said was misread and misinterpreted like a user has mentioned supposedly reformation dresses cost them 10 to make but they then mark it up to the xxx price tag and spent the money with influencers  i dont know if thats true or not but regardless of whether it is or not it gives an example that may show that a brand probably isnt abiding by the values that they say their brand has which was my whole point in the first place



edit just finished reading the post from their exemployee talking about their discrimination and it makes me sick to my stomach one thing is for sure im not going to be supporting their brand does anyone have any good actual sustainable and ethical brands alternatives preferably european brands since im from europe

edit 2 i want to share this quote with all the lovely people that replied and are commenting on this post but instead of spamming the comments im going to add it here

which is a quote i refer back to whenever i feel frustrated or sad with these topics

 you cant do all the good the world needs but the world needs all the good you can do

edit 3 oh and i also just want to say a huge thank you to all of you who are sharing and commenting with information that is relevant to these topics im learning more than what i knew from you and thats exactly the reason why i decided to post about this so i could be more informed so thank you for sharing your knowledge

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,I care about the ethical/ecological impact of my clothing. Where (else) can I shop?,"I started reading r/femalefashionadvice last week, and I'm impressed with the breadth/depth of fashion knowledge. Apologies in advance for the novel, but I want to follow the rules for asking for help, and I would appreciate your ideas.

Height: 5'4""
Weight: 145-150 lbs. (I generally buy Small/size 6-8 for tops and dresses, and size 8-10 for bottoms.)
Age: 31
Body type: Pear-shaped

Why: I haven't bought many new clothes in years, and my wardrobe is showing its age. I want clothing made somewhere/somehow that workers have fair conditions, and materials/processes are environmentally friendly - and I want good quality and durability. I like to buy US-made when I can find it. I've lost weight over the past couple of years; things that used to fit are now sloppy. Also, it seems like eco-friendly/ethical clothing is either very high-fashion or incredibly frumpy. Sometimes I give up on my values and buy something because I need it now and don't have time for an extensive search. It would be a wonderful luxury to try on clothes before I buy them, instead of ordering online all the time.

Here's the state of my search so far:
*For organic cotton panties, socks, and basic v-neck t-shirts, I love and would recommend [PACT](http://www.wearpact.com/)
*[Loomstate](http://www.loomstate.org/) isn't making denim anymore - just very fashion-forward project stuff.
*[Blue Canoe](http://www.bluecanoe.com) purchases stretched and pilled.
*I have jeans and cardigans from [Hessnatur](http://us.hessnatur.com). Foreign transaction fees; delivery takes weeks. I'm waiting for some slim jeans for which I have high hopes. They *are* great about sourcing only eco-friendly/ethical stuff.
*I bought the [Ibex Energy FZ zip-up](http://shop.ibex.com/Apparel/Womens-Long-Sleeve/Energy-Full-Zip) in black and in grey a few weeks ago and have been wearing them ever since. I'm considering some of their t-shirts for summer.
*I have some t-shirts from American Apparel, but their stuff is mostly too trendy for me.
*I'm ordering a pair of Frye Veronica Slouch boots.

Me now: I wear jeans, a t-shirt, a cardigan/zip-up, and a colorful scarf nearly every day. Shoes I wear most often now are Sperry Angelfish and navy low-cut Chucks. Other times of the year, I wear various Dansko clogs or navy Hunter wellies. I have several print full skirts and dresses, and several cocktail dresses and formal dresses (that are too big now and should be tailored.) I have pewter Cole Haan ballet wedges, black Anne Klein sling-backs, and brown Dansko pumps with two buckle straps to I wear with dresses; I really can't do a heel more than 2.5"".

Me after: I want to look like me, only a bit more elegant and classic. I'd like a couple of feminine blouses in a material other than cotton (maybe one solid and one print), a blazer/tailored jacket to substitute for a cardigan/zip-up, a couple pairs of dark jeans in various cuts, and tailored, well-fitting pants in black and grey or tan. I like the look of drapey knit tops. I've been thinking about a pair of Bermuda shorts for summer. I've been looking for years for a great white button-down shirt. I have several nice pieces of jewelry that I should wear more often.

Budget: I probably spend $1000 on regular clothing over the course of the year, but I maybe only buy 5-8 pieces of clothing a year. I'm comfortable spending several hundred dollars at a time, especially if there's a specific need (like an outfit for an event), but I love a great deal just like anyone else.

I know that I should spend some time in thrift shops to re-use rather than buy new and would appreciate recommendations in the greater Boston area that go beyond Garment District. I'm also looking for stores/websites where I can buy new clothes that match my style and my values. Thanks for your help!

Update: I cleaned my closet this weekend, and I have some things to take to Goodwill. I'm going to live with the less cluttered collection of clothing for awhile, make a good list of what's missing, visit some thrift stores, and then, when I've exhausted my other options, take another stab at shopping online for things I can't find elsewhere.

i know that i should spend some time in thrift shops to reuse rather than buy new and would appreciate recommendations in the greater boston area that go beyond garment district im also looking for storeswebsites where i can buy new clothes that match my style and my values thanks for your help

update i cleaned my closet this weekend and i have some things to take to goodwill im going to live with the less cluttered collection of clothing for awhile make a good list of whats missing visit some thrift stores and then when ive exhausted my other options take another stab at shopping online for things i cant find elsewhere thanks for the suggestions",Positive
femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,"I'm compiling advice from Reddit/others on making fabric/fiber choices, natural vs synthetic, etc. Here's what I have so far.","Notes:

* Background: I'm a complete novice trying to a) understand and b) put these concepts into simple, actionable guidelines that even I can use.
* Goal was to help less with background knowledge (the sidebar has an excellent source for that) and more with how to apply it/make selections. That's still a work in progress.
* Started this for my own use before deciding to share, so I apologize that I haven't attributed sources.
* Please feel more than welcome to advice anything you think will help me or other ""newbies"" to make real-world (and virtual) choices.

&#x200B;

Factors people considered when choosing fabric/fibers:

* Allergies/medical and sensory/itchy
* Concerns re: environment/animal welfare
* Expense
* Level of care (quick to dry, need to dry-clean, able to go in dryer, need to iron)
* ‚ÄúFeel‚Äù (static, smoothness)
* Performance (warmth, breathability - but camping/etc another topic/world)
* Durability (piling, wrinkling, running/holes)
* Appearance (draping, clinging, stiffness)

&#x200B;

Background knowledge/caveats:

* 100% natural is often not better (more below).
* Thicker fabric is better, but cotton, wool and linen usually good even when thin (e.g., linen jersey knit). Exception: ‚ÄúThick cotton knit sweaters don't feel very warm to me and seem to lose their shape quickly.‚Äù (Think this refers more to the knit than the weave/fiber - and agree - they tend to look soggy and shapeless on me regardless of how nice on model).
* Factors that make garment last and hold its shape: tighter weave, fewer types of fibers mixed in, fewer seams (not sure how to tell online). Part of reason lower-quality Merino pills and doesn‚Äôt last - short, slender fibers, woven loose to be softer. ‚ÄúMerino is good as long as it's decent quality!‚Äù
* Can use quality of stitching to determine if a higher quality fabric - regardless of what the fabric is made of (synthetic/natural/etc). ‚ÄúFrench seams, properly fashioned buttonholes, even hems and a lack of puckering/loose threads‚Äù. Construction is pivotal.
* Experience - pay attention, touch fabrics in stores, read tags. Inspect after taking home/washing.
* The same type of fabric (or fibers, more accurately) isn‚Äôt universal. ‚ÄúIf you're used to modern mall cashmere, vintage cashmere is a revelation.‚Äù
* Stop washing things so much. Sweaters once a year. Avoid dryer and hang instead of folding, except knits (stretch out). ""This is the one exception on how to hang your knits: [https://www.today.com/style/how-hang-your-sweaters-without-ruining-them-t118188](https://www.today.com/style/how-hang-your-sweaters-without-ruining-them-t118188)""
* ‚Äúusing tap cold water and a more gentle laundry soap... not washing clothes after every wear as long as they‚Äôre still clean.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI hang dry all my clothes and I attribute this to why I have clothes that have been in and out of heavy rotation without being terribly worse for wear for a decade.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Natural versus natural-synthetic blends:

* Natural is best as a **base** (unless you don‚Äôt like it - e.g., wrinkles with linen). However, good proportion felt that with about 20% synthetic mixed in was more durable, keep their shape better, less sag over time, prevent holes/runs, extend life.
* Natural: Cotton, linen (some don‚Äôt like wrinkles), wool (some don‚Äôt like itchiness/piling, especially looser weaves), cashmere (piling, some don‚Äôt like care required), silk (some don‚Äôt like care required), leather (some only buy used), hemp. ‚ÄúRamie‚Ä¶ it's not that it's brittle, it's that it's quite stiff, so good for heavier weights. Pants or skirts that need weight and body, or boxy jackets.‚Äú
* ‚ÄúLots of people prefer natural fibers‚Ä¶ drape better and are more comfortable, less staticky and less prone to odors. But there is a huge variation in quality depending on not only fiber length but also construction and thickness.‚Äù
* Most will not buy blends if more than 50% synthetic. However, the more ‚Äúwear‚Äù it gets (socks, athletic clothing, rain gear/outerwear, bathing suits, and especially technical gear like a rucksack which may be 100%) the most synthetic seems acceptable to people. However, some still avoid polyester anyway because ""stinky.""
* Good baseline choices: ‚ÄúMoisture wicking and temperature regulating (cotton/wool/silk/lyocell/modal)‚Äù
* On ethics/animal cruelty: ""I think a good balance here, as others have already suggested, is to buy wool and leather only used... stick to cotton, denim, linen, hemp, etc. when buying new.""
* Caveat: ‚ÄúI work as an apparel designer specializing in compression bottoms (lots of poly/spandex and nylon/spandex blends). There is no hard and fast rule what will pill and what won't. Nylon tends to be more durable but it often comes down to the type of knit and how the fibers were created. For bottoms we almost exclusively used nylon/spandex due to its durability but occasionally would have to use poly/spandex if we were sublimating the bottoms. The last place I worked had a materials testing lab in house and sometimes a fabric would pass the pilling/abrasion tests and then fail in real life situations.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Specific blends:

* ‚ÄúI like linen and cotton poly blends sometimes as they're more wrinkle-resistant and drape a bit more softly or offer stretch‚Äù ‚ÄúMy favorite shirts are cotton/poly blends as they wear well and don‚Äôt fade over time. ‚Äú
* Conversely: ‚ÄúPolyester-cotton blends pill immediately.‚Äù ‚ÄúPilling is common in poly cotton blends when the cotton starts to separate from the polyester. All cotton clothing rarely has this issue.‚Äù ""I wouldn't buy poly blend sweatshirts again, they pill in the most upsetting way over time.""
* ‚ÄúI like a bit of elastine since I hate fabrics without stretch.‚Äù
* Jeans: directly conflicting opinions: ‚ÄúFor jeans, I prefer really soft and stretchy cotton/poly/spandex blends. Higher-end blends usually have fantastic shape retention, and they are so comfortable.‚Äù Conversely:‚ÄúI \~hate\~ that most jeans now are like 60% cotton, 40% random stuff. They wear out so quickly! What happened to the 98% cotton, 2% elastane ones? Just enough stretch and lasted forever. I can even handle 92% cotton and 8% something else. I just detest‚Ä¶ stretched out after some light use. I expect to‚Ä¶ wash and wear them until the butt wears through.‚Äù
* Some even prefer 100% cotton jeans (doesn‚Äôt start to over-stretch and sag during day as modern poorer-quality jeans. I‚Äôm curvy so this sounds terrible to me!)
* ‚Äú100% wool (sheep's wool, lambswool, mohair) tends to irritate my skin, so I love cashmere, alpaca, merino, or wool blends.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI find that 100% wool and alpaca knits are too itchy, so the blend can actually improve the texture.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúMy favorite so far has been a 96% wool plus 4% synthetic blend. Still has all the feel, drape and durability of wool but with just a little extra stretch. I know that‚Äôs oddly specific but my best quality work clothes are inevitably this blend.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI like wool/nylon blends. Nylon helps strengthen and cuts down on pilling a bit‚Ä¶ I usually knit my own stuff but I go with 25-30% nylon.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúFor knitwear‚Ä¶ I avoid anything made up of more than 3 materials‚Ä¶ more likely to rub against each other and pill more quickly.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThin blended knits will let you down over time.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Pet hair:

* Have to lint roll before laundry, otherwise hair gets on other clothes and causes expensive plumbing repairs. Tumble dry 10 minutes with dryer sheet or balls BEFORE washing to release hair, clean lint trap. Vinegar in fabric softener slot. Moisten dryer balls. Hair starts with pet, brush them.
* Choose smooth, tightly-woven fabrics (no idea how to determine online).
* Dog hair: ‚ÄúI don't buy anything that has lint on it in the store, secondhand or new, because that means it will attract dog hair‚Ä¶ eliminates almost all velvet, corduroy, and other high-pile fabrics. Wool is an iffy one and has to be determined piece by piece.‚Äù
* ‚Äúavoided that outdoorsy fleece material... it‚Äôs impossible to get dog hair off of it‚Äù

&#x200B;

Cotton:

* Easy to find poor quality. Better example brands: arket, kos.
* Pima cotton - longer fiber, softer, durable, luxurious
* Alternatives sustainable: hemp, ramie, linen, tencel
* Opinion: ‚ÄúCotton is best left for underwear and sheets‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI rarely buy cotton or imitation cotton (made from various synthetics like polyester, viscose, rayon - it's more about that t-shirt material look/feel than the actual fabric, as I have excellent luck buying polyester chiffon). These fabrics pill horribly, fade in color, and often attract lint and dog hair. They look new when they are new and never again after that. Poplin cotton is an exception, as I don't tend to have problems with non-stretch, woven cotton items.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúJersey cotton - I mostly buy 100% cotton tees. One of my favourites is made with thick ring-spun cotton. My Grana pima tee is both thin and soft. Probably my most expensive tee is from James Perse and the jersey cotton is so soft and thin and hasn‚Äôt pilled a bit - changed my mind about not spending on tees. I‚Äôve had good luck with LOFT for cheaper tees.‚Äù
* ""Denim (cotton) deserves a shoutout. It's all around one of the sturdiest, best all-around quality, longest-lasting, lowest maintenance materials in existence. It's also easier than many fabrics to mend, and is more resilient to minor damage. It checks all the boxes. Of course it's possible to buy low-quality denim, but I'd rather that than any other low-quality fabric.""
* ""I love cotton poplin or cotton satin for dresses. They're very crisp and smooth, which gives them a more formal or fancy look in my opinion. They also don't wrinkle too much if I pull them out of the washer promptly. For tshirts I like a medium weight ringspun cotton usually, but there are a lot of styles I like. Basically anything except the kind of cheap cotton that quickly grows fuzzy.""

&#x200B;

Wool (sheep), Cashmere (goat), and Mohair (goat), Angora (bunny), Alpaca (alpaca):

* ""Cashmere, lambswool, merino, mohair, angora, alpaca, vicuna, camel, wool crepe, 100% wool blends, wool/acrylic blends. These all have different properties. Personally I can not wear knit lambswool or wool blends due the itch factor. But for some reason, I can wear merino despite it being higher in lanolin, which is associated with itching and skin reaction... Many wool types do not have lanolin, and don't seem to cause as much itching: Alpaca, vicuna, etc.""
* ""Most, if not all, wool is sold in grades. For many, the higher the grade, the longer the fiber, the better the product. You can still buy premium cashmere that is soft as vintage cashmere, but it's incredibly expensive and hard to find. I find that merino wool has a wide range of quality, a lot of low quality merino has flooded the market in the last 2 decades.""
* Wool: ""best known in the fashion industry is the Merino sheep breed, which have extra fluffy soft wool, and the Shetland, which have coarser, tougher fiber. Merino is delicate wool you want next to your skin; Shetland is itchy wool that'll outlast you and possibly your grandkids.""
* ""I like wool especially for outerwear. It's super warm and somewhat waterproof. It's worth investing in a nicer wool though.""
* ""Mohair: from the other goats! Known for a floaty halo of floof around a sturdy strand of yarn, though it does come in other varieties. Shockingly warm, can be a little bit prickly feeling.""
* Cashmere - long lasting and durable, warmer and easier to care for than wool, luxurious, easier. There are grade A through C, A has longest and finest yarn, more ply.
* Cashmere: ""Softer than merino, but also far more expensive, because these particular goats have a pretty limited climate range and also there are a lot more steps between shave goat and get sweater than there are between shave sheep and get sweater.""
* ""Cheaper manufacturers (looking at you Quince) use 100% wool BUT the fibers that make up the wool are shorter and therefore will pill more easily""
* Conversely: ""I own a lot of cashmere of all price ranges, from one of a kind hand knit pieces to fancy vintage stuff to department store brands. I‚Äôve found quince to have significantly better quality than modern department store brands like Bloomingdale‚Äôs, charter club etc. It‚Äôs definitely on the thin side, but it‚Äôs soft and strong and not itchy.""
* ""Angora: from the softest fluffiest bunnies you've ever seen... Similar ""halo"" effect as mohair. Softest fiber on this list, light as air, and insanely warm. Feels like being hugged by the platonic ideal of coziness. Not durable at all, but does well in blends.""
* ""Alpaca: Usually somewhere between Merino wool and cashmere on the softness scale, and warmer than either. Smoother to the touch than either of those fibers. Very drapey, but can have some difficulty holding its shape unless blended with another fiber. While calling it hypoallergenic is a stretch, it is true that some people with allergies to wool and cashmere find they do just fine with alpaca.""
* ""The highest grade of alpaca is called ""baby alpaca."" It's not from babies, it's from the super soft shorter hairs that grow on the chest of alpacas. In Peru, there are a lot of unmarked acrylic/alpaca blends that are sold to tourists as ""baby alpaca."" The joke is that it's ""maybe alpaca."" I've seen similar alpaca/acrylic blends pop up in US malls around Christmas. I'd avoid it. You can get 100% baby alpaca from reputable brands in/imported directly from Peru. It will have a content label on it, and the softness will BLOW YOUR MIND.""

&#x200B;

More on Cashmere (goat):

* ""cashmere farming is also destroyed/ destroying an ecosystem""
* ""My cashmere sweaters are all made in Scotland. They certainly do pill, but Scottish cashmere is supposed to be more durable, and I've found they held up pretty well over time.""
* ‚Äú100% Cashmere sweaters really are worth it imo‚Äù
* ‚ÄúCashmere is very nice but it can be hot and difficult to maintain.‚Äù
* Debate about ethics: ""I wear cashmere on a daily basis and I live in CA. Nothing is comparably soft and breathable for the winter season. It only has to be washed 2-3 times over the whole season compared to cotton which needs to be washed every wear...  if not a cashmere sweater every day... If I weren‚Äôt cold then I‚Äôd to be covered uncomfortable bulk. Furthermore, there are serious ethical considerations regarding cotton as well... cashmere lasts decades... Every thrift store is full of it. There‚Äôs nothing more sustainable/cruelty free than buying secondhand clothes or wearing the clothes you have for decades. ""

&#x200B;

Linen (flax)

* Huge difference between thick versus thin - quality matters here
* Shouldn‚Äôt be sheer, especially trousers
* ‚ÄúCan only compare Uniqlo linen with Massimo Dutti, Rag&Bone, or COS: quality and price are mostly seen in the latter in stuff like buttons (mother of pearl/metal not just plastic), overall more modern cut, and more interesting colors. The cloth itself is almost identical, slightly more polished with a bit more luster in more expensive brands if I‚Äôm being really really picky.‚Äù
* ""I search for linen clothes on resale websites/apps... because I can see how various brands hold up over time and use. Crappy, unedited photos that people post are infinitely times better for seeing how a garment holds up over time than a professional ad photo. Also if you like vintage clothing, the 90s had an absolute field day with linen and there are tonnnssss of clothes out there (on Poshmark, eBay, Mercari, etc.) that are on-trend again.‚Äù
* ""Linen... can be ironed less. If you go for a washed linen with a soft, slightly rumpled look, rather than starched and pressed linen, you can wash and dry it. Immediately remove it from the dryer, and enjoy its softness and loose feel (and warmth from the dryer. It's very cozy).""
* ""Linen... works great for all year, it keeps me cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and I love the way it softens with age. It does wrinkle a lot but I don't really mind, it's quick and easy to iron. I generally go for a pre-softened linen in shirts because I wish to avoid the scratchy phase, even though I know it will get soft.""

&#x200B;

Silk

* ""Silk... is great for thermoregulating... looks very pretty, it can be stiff or soft and slippery depending on the weave and thickness. The downside is it's harder to care for. When I make my own clothes, I generally prewash my silk in water to allow any shrinking or texture changes to happen up front, which makes my life easier later.""
* ‚ÄúSilk jersey is amazing. Slinky, and can be classy and sexy at the same time. Doesn't wrinkle.‚Äù
* ‚Äúsilk twill‚Äù - silk in a thicker, sturdier twill weave. It‚Äôs just all the softness and shine of silk but just enough structure to make collars and cuffs lie sharp and enough thickness/opacity so I don‚Äôt have to worry about anything showing underneath.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Leather and suede:

* ""There's a lot of different kinds of leather. I personally like vegetable-tanned full-grain leather, but it is not suitable for something like a skirt or pants.""

&#x200B;

Understanding semi-synthetic (made from biological materials like trees) products:

* ""Generation 1 - Rayon: sometimes called viscose rayon or artificial silk... high luster and bright shine whilst feeling soft and smooth to wear."" \[Notes: production process is bad for the environment compared to the other two; see below, many people do not like other qualities of rayon\]. ""It was the first regenerated cellulose fibre, patented as ‚Äúartificial silk‚Äù in 1894.""
* ""Generation 2 - Modal: The second generation of cellulose fibre. Its softness has been enhanced and strength has been added to the fabric so that it doesn‚Äôt shrink or stretch when wet."" 1951.
* ""Generation 3 - Lyocell: The latest development in cellulose fabric technology. It‚Äôs better for the environment... retains the softness, drape and potential antibacterial properties of previous generations."" 1990s.
* ""Viscose, modal and lyocell are very similar... might be forgiven for calling them all viscose... man-made but they are not synthetic. In fact, as fibres that are man-made from a natural product, we might call them semi-synthetic fabrics.""
* Tencel is brand name (Green Austrian company) that makes lyocell (from eucalyptus) and modal (beech tree).
* Lyocell ""is one of the most sustainable production processes of any modern material... recovering over 99% of the solvent.. highly energy efficient and powered by bioenergy. The wood... all sustainably sourced and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This has helped Lenzing‚Äôs TENCEL‚Ñ¢ Lyocell gain the ‚ÄúEuropean Award for the Environment‚Äù.""
* ""Modal is usually high in stretch and the fiber is shorter in terms of length than lyocell. Whereas lyocell is the long length fiber which has more bones and shine comparing to modal.Tencel lyocell is the best lyocell and it's the best man-made wood fiber within all kinds.""
* ""Viscose, modal and lyocell are all made from plant material... the fibre itself is composed of long chains of cellulose molecules that have been lined up to make a useful filament (very long continuous fibre), not unlike silk. This plant-based chemical structure is what gives these textiles their desirable properties... natural next-to-skin softness, breathability and good moisture management.""
* """"Lyocell"" = lyocell-rayon cellulose derived from plant materials""Viscose"" = viscose-rayon cellulose derived from plant materials""Modal"" = lyocell/viscose-rayon cellulose derived from beechwood""Bamboo""= lyocell/viscose-rayon cellulose derived from bamboo""
* ""Lyocell: ""the absorption of the water in Tencel¬Æ (lyocell) is more uniform. This internal structure is a product of the different manufacturing process and gives fabrics made from Tencel¬Æ improved moisture absorbency and breathability.""
* Lyocell ""feels and wears infinitely better than other synthetics. It gets a very positive write up on the credible sustainability watchdog sites. Modal and lyocel (maybe also cupro?) also have a quality edge on ordinary viscose and rayon.""
* ""Rayon.. incredibly soft and comfortable to wear and can be easily dyed into whatever colours you desire. Rayon is breathable and wicks moisture from the skin... does not pill... feels gentle on your skin and provides moderate resistance to wrinkling... delicate wash, as it does lose strength when wet. Ironing should be fine but it is less resistant to high temperatures than cotton, so can shrink if tumble dried.""
* ""Modal... same properties as regular rayon but... strength when wet... more soft than rayon, making it ideal for intimate body contact... underwear or sports clothing. The additional strength... machine washable and can be tumble dried without shrinking or stretching... hold their colour well so typically don‚Äôt fade or gray over time.""
* ""lyocell... can absorb moisture around 50% more quickly than cotton and release it into the atmosphere... sports clothes... intimate garments, bedding or sheets... breathable... maintain and regulate body temperature... clothes should stay smelling fresher for longer. This limits the number of times that an item needs to be washed, which is key to dressing more sustainably. In comparison, bacteria are able to thrive on man made synthetics like nylon or polyester. ""
* ""Like modal, lyocell also has the benefit of being durable even when wet. It doesn‚Äôt wrinkle or crease easily, making it a particularly good material to wear if you are one of those people who hates ironing (like me). The versatility of this fabric means it's perfect for anything from light silky flowy dresses, flexible activewear, sheets or even stiffer shirts.""

&#x200B;

Synthetic or sort-of-synthetic materials people liked best:

* ""vastly different levels of quality when it comes to synthetics, and when used deliberately in a garment they can be superior. Fast fashion like Free People or Shein or whatever are going to sell you the garbage quality version, but there are amazing quality plant leathers, polyesters, and so on to be found.""
* Tencel (I believe referring to Lyocell here) are easy to care for, arguably natural/biodegradable rather than strictly synthetic, light and soft, mimic expensive fabrics. ‚ÄúI have a pair of jeans and a chambray shirt in tencel and they're both SO SOFT.‚Äù ‚ÄúTencel, it drapes and washes so nicely!‚Äù ‚ÄùIt doesn‚Äôt wrinkle as much as the cotton Oxford shirts‚Äù
* Modal (beech tree). ‚ÄúFor tees, I like all/mostly cotton (practical, usually comfortable) or modal (sometimes harder to care for but soooo comfy).‚Äù ""IME, modal quality varies widely."" Contrary opinion: ‚ÄúModal bc it stains and rips like a MFer. Or me and the kids are extra hard on clothes?‚Äù
* Spandex. Spandex does not fatigue, stretch, strong, durable, light, soft. Resistant to body oil, perspiration, beach. (A couple contrary opinions: ‚Äúlycra/spandex/elastine. It's basically rubber band thread and will often shorten the life of your clothing because it breaks down more quickly than natural fibers.‚Äù‚ÄúI find even a small amount of spandex to be suffocating, especially in hot weather.‚Äù)
* Nylon. Durable, elastic, resilient, ranges from lustrous to dull. Nylon pills easily, static. ‚ÄúNylon or polyamide is generally better than polyester.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúPolyester and nylon technical fabrics can work if thick.‚Äù Some synthetic if thick- carefully constructed can look good [https://shop-links.co/cjScbV1akd2](https://shop-links.co/cjScbV1akd2)

&#x200B;

The polyester debate:

* Polyester: Durable, easy to care for, good shape retention, lightweight, elastic, strong, crisp and resilient wet or dry, resists wrinkles, dries quickly. Does not absorb moisture well, pills easily, attracts odors. Difficult to iron, but doesn‚Äôt require much ironing. Newer will resist pilling, wick moisture, emulate silk.
* ‚ÄúI frequently buy polyester, particularly chiffon, silk, and satin polyester. Poly has a bad rep for valid reasons (not great for sweat, harmful to the environment), but wearing something for years and never seeing the color fade or the fabric pill, never having to iron it, never needing to dry clean it - those reasons are more than enough for me to claim it as my favorite fabric.‚Äù
* Versus: ‚Äúoften relatively inexpensive, sturdy and easy to care for. However, I tend to dislike the look and feel of most 100% polyester chiffon, crepe, or satin, so i usually won't buy those.‚Äù
* My favourite polyester fabric is the crepe one that Aritzia does - it‚Äôs thick and feels like silk (I pet my pants when I‚Äôm wearing them).
* ‚ÄúPolyester gets an unfair bad rap. There's a polyester like Uniqlo Airism which is light, cool to the skin, breathable, and quick-drying. And there's a Shein polyester blouse that feels like a plastic bag.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúFor polyester, I only buy online if it‚Äôs cheap and easy to return.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI generally only buy polyester for athletic wear.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúPet peeve I absolutely hate polyester scarves. Too shine-y and they do not drape well and they get unknotted. I am not a material snob about everything but with scarves I am. I do not like viscose or modal scarves either, for other reasons, but I hate those a little less than polyester.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúUniqlo has some great polyester fabrics like Airism and Extra Warm Heattech. Most of their cotton is good. I have some of their cotton dresses that I can hang dry and they barely wrinkle. But their silk, linen and rayon is lower quality. My thrifted silk and linen pieces from Talbots are way better quality.‚Äù

&#x200B;

The rayon/viscose debate (VERY NUANCED!)

* Note: while Tencel's modal and lyocell are technically rayon, they are newer, generated far differently (better for environment), and far different structurally (improved properties versus old rayon). When people say ""rayon"" - (including below), they typically are referring to the old (1891) version .
* ""Viscose and rayon are essentially the same thing, but viscose has a longer fiber.""
* ""Never Rayon or viscose"" - wrinkly, twisted hems, terrible after first wash. Unnatural looking wrinkles.
* Rayon: ""Freaking rayon shrinks every time I don't hand wash it but it doesn't have magical odor resistant properties like merino, so it actually needs to be washed pretty often.‚Äù
* ""I hang everything to dry and do laundry 3x/week. It wrinkles if you look at it wrong. Rayon is famous for being literally the most wrinkly fabric aside from linen. It‚Äôs also very structurally weak and prone to wearing out faster.""
* ""I live in the tropics so my ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äúcold‚Äù water is warm at best in the summer. CANNOT TELL YOU how many rayon items have been washed and come out child sized.""
* Conversely: ""I NEVER understand the hate on rayon - in my experience it washes great, doesn't wrinkle, and holds up for a long time. I have rayon shirts and skirts from over five years ago that look brand new. super underrated fabric imo""
* ""Yes, it is a delicate fabric. It does wear out if subject to repeated friction, and it tears easily. So does silk! Delicate fabric is not necessarily bad. It's great for summer because it's very breathable.""
* ""I have very mixed experiences with rayon. Some of it holds up beautifully, but I‚Äôve also had rayon where the color faded after just a few washes and it pilled like crazy.""
* ""I don't wear a lot of rayon, but I prefer rayon or a rayon blend over other silk replacements. I haven't had any problem machine washing it, but I also specifically choose pieces that are labeled machine washable.""
* ""If you don't use a dryer, there will be some creases from the spin cycle. Again, the length of time it is creased plays a role. If you handwash and immediately hang up, or you get it as soon as the washer stops, you can basically smooth out the wrinkles with your hand (except hems on a bias can get twisted). But air dried linen and rayon won't be as soft as it is when it come out of the dryer. If it sits in the washing machine after a spin cycle, the creases will definitely need to be ironed out.""
* ""The vintage rayon slips I have will still last a very long time.""
* ""I love rayon and viscose. The tight weave that looks similar to cotton has a wonderful drape. It holds dye better than cotton. The trick is buying it oversized, then washing it and expecting shrink. Rayon skirts, dresses, and blouses are wonderfully light and breezy in the summer time. Personally I wash it and take it out of the dryer IMMEDIATELY and it doesn't need to be ironed. It only needs ironing if you let it get crumpled in a pile.""
* Viscose - unflattering cling, wrinkles way too much, requires steaming/maintenance.
* Viscose: ‚Äúuseless and flimsy as that ridiculous fabric. It shrinks with any water, reacts poorly to sweat, is probably the least durable material I can think of‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIt has always pilled super quickly for me and it never feels or looks the same after the first wash. Though I'll admit I own a few pieces that are blends‚Ä¶ 25% or less viscose content. They seem to do ok, but I like natural fibers (cotton, wool, linen) much better.‚Äù
* ‚Äùmost of the time steam it before wear, and it will be wrinkly after a few hours.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Synthetics most people recommend against:

* Acrylic - staunch advocates against. Microplastics, do not regulate temperature, ‚ÄúMake a sweater look immediately cheaply made 90% of the time to me. Once you get an eye for acrylic, you‚Äôll know right away.‚Äù ‚Äúmake my hair super staticky‚Ä¶ pill like crazy as soon as they're washed. Hard pass on acrylic sweaters.‚Äù ‚ÄúAcrylic seems to be the worst for pilling and polyester comes a close second. And some wool blends pill.‚Äù‚Äù
* Avoid Acrylic knits - only looks good a few wears - then dingy and misshapen. Soft, warm wool replacement, can machine wash, spun to replicate cotton, do not absorb moisture, shrink, pill easily. Resists damage/wrinkles, dries quickly. Monoacrylic - fleece or faux fur. Durable, warm, pill and mat easily.
* Conversely: ‚ÄúSo, Simons (a department store in Canada) sells acrylic sweaters and winter accessories made of 100% acrylic in Germany‚Ä¶ 10 years ago. I treated them like real wool, washed in cloth bags, air dry, no strong agitation. They are still in good shape, and have developed a soft fuzzy halo like alpaca, with minimal pillings. A few good winter brands also use acrylic like Kombi and Bula. I guess I got lucky because my positive experience with synthetic fibres is thank to responsible and reputable retailers.‚Äù

As you can see, this isn't ""complete"" - more of a work in progress. I was compiling this for my own use as someone who knows nothing;  most of you are far more knowledgable and have a lot you could add to it, so I'm open to additions and revisions!

&#x200B;

EDIT: In progress: I am incorporated some of the comments below. Currently trying to cut down. Note: to maintain the readability, I did not use ""EDIT"" for changes. Special thanks to larger passages from: /u/monster_roses, /u/One-Access2535, /u/SpiritedContribution, /u/DiagonEllie, [https://cariki.co.uk/blogs/the-green-road/difference-between-tencel-modal-rayon-lyocell](https://cariki.co.uk/blogs/the-green-road/difference-between-tencel-modal-rayon-lyocell)",1706898251.0,"I'm compiling advice from Reddit/others on making fabric/fiber choices, natural vs synthetic, etc. Here's what I have so far. Notes:

* Background: I'm a complete novice trying to a) understand and b) put these concepts into simple, actionable guidelines that even I can use.
* Goal was to help less with background knowledge (the sidebar has an excellent source for that) and more with how to apply it/make selections. That's still a work in progress.
* Started this for my own use before deciding to share, so I apologize that I haven't attributed sources.
* Please feel more than welcome to advice anything you think will help me or other ""newbies"" to make real-world (and virtual) choices.

&#x200B;

Factors people considered when choosing fabric/fibers:

* Allergies/medical and sensory/itchy
* Concerns re: environment/animal welfare
* Expense
* Level of care (quick to dry, need to dry-clean, able to go in dryer, need to iron)
* ‚ÄúFeel‚Äù (static, smoothness)
* Performance (warmth, breathability - but camping/etc another topic/world)
* Durability (piling, wrinkling, running/holes)
* Appearance (draping, clinging, stiffness)

&#x200B;

Background knowledge/caveats:

* 100% natural is often not better (more below).
* Thicker fabric is better, but cotton, wool and linen usually good even when thin (e.g., linen jersey knit). Exception: ‚ÄúThick cotton knit sweaters don't feel very warm to me and seem to lose their shape quickly.‚Äù (Think this refers more to the knit than the weave/fiber - and agree - they tend to look soggy and shapeless on me regardless of how nice on model).
* Factors that make garment last and hold its shape: tighter weave, fewer types of fibers mixed in, fewer seams (not sure how to tell online). Part of reason lower-quality Merino pills and doesn‚Äôt last - short, slender fibers, woven loose to be softer. ‚ÄúMerino is good as long as it's decent quality!‚Äù
* Can use quality of stitching to determine if a higher quality fabric - regardless of what the fabric is made of (synthetic/natural/etc). ‚ÄúFrench seams, properly fashioned buttonholes, even hems and a lack of puckering/loose threads‚Äù. Construction is pivotal.
* Experience - pay attention, touch fabrics in stores, read tags. Inspect after taking home/washing.
* The same type of fabric (or fibers, more accurately) isn‚Äôt universal. ‚ÄúIf you're used to modern mall cashmere, vintage cashmere is a revelation.‚Äù
* Stop washing things so much. Sweaters once a year. Avoid dryer and hang instead of folding, except knits (stretch out). ""This is the one exception on how to hang your knits: [https://www.today.com/style/how-hang-your-sweaters-without-ruining-them-t118188](https://www.today.com/style/how-hang-your-sweaters-without-ruining-them-t118188)""
* ‚Äúusing tap cold water and a more gentle laundry soap... not washing clothes after every wear as long as they‚Äôre still clean.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI hang dry all my clothes and I attribute this to why I have clothes that have been in and out of heavy rotation without being terribly worse for wear for a decade.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Natural versus natural-synthetic blends:

* Natural is best as a **base** (unless you don‚Äôt like it - e.g., wrinkles with linen). However, good proportion felt that with about 20% synthetic mixed in was more durable, keep their shape better, less sag over time, prevent holes/runs, extend life.
* Natural: Cotton, linen (some don‚Äôt like wrinkles), wool (some don‚Äôt like itchiness/piling, especially looser weaves), cashmere (piling, some don‚Äôt like care required), silk (some don‚Äôt like care required), leather (some only buy used), hemp. ‚ÄúRamie‚Ä¶ it's not that it's brittle, it's that it's quite stiff, so good for heavier weights. Pants or skirts that need weight and body, or boxy jackets.‚Äú
* ‚ÄúLots of people prefer natural fibers‚Ä¶ drape better and are more comfortable, less staticky and less prone to odors. But there is a huge variation in quality depending on not only fiber length but also construction and thickness.‚Äù
* Most will not buy blends if more than 50% synthetic. However, the more ‚Äúwear‚Äù it gets (socks, athletic clothing, rain gear/outerwear, bathing suits, and especially technical gear like a rucksack which may be 100%) the most synthetic seems acceptable to people. However, some still avoid polyester anyway because ""stinky.""
* Good baseline choices: ‚ÄúMoisture wicking and temperature regulating (cotton/wool/silk/lyocell/modal)‚Äù
* On ethics/animal cruelty: ""I think a good balance here, as others have already suggested, is to buy wool and leather only used... stick to cotton, denim, linen, hemp, etc. when buying new.""
* Caveat: ‚ÄúI work as an apparel designer specializing in compression bottoms (lots of poly/spandex and nylon/spandex blends). There is no hard and fast rule what will pill and what won't. Nylon tends to be more durable but it often comes down to the type of knit and how the fibers were created. For bottoms we almost exclusively used nylon/spandex due to its durability but occasionally would have to use poly/spandex if we were sublimating the bottoms. The last place I worked had a materials testing lab in house and sometimes a fabric would pass the pilling/abrasion tests and then fail in real life situations.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Specific blends:

* ‚ÄúI like linen and cotton poly blends sometimes as they're more wrinkle-resistant and drape a bit more softly or offer stretch‚Äù ‚ÄúMy favorite shirts are cotton/poly blends as they wear well and don‚Äôt fade over time. ‚Äú
* Conversely: ‚ÄúPolyester-cotton blends pill immediately.‚Äù ‚ÄúPilling is common in poly cotton blends when the cotton starts to separate from the polyester. All cotton clothing rarely has this issue.‚Äù ""I wouldn't buy poly blend sweatshirts again, they pill in the most upsetting way over time.""
* ‚ÄúI like a bit of elastine since I hate fabrics without stretch.‚Äù
* Jeans: directly conflicting opinions: ‚ÄúFor jeans, I prefer really soft and stretchy cotton/poly/spandex blends. Higher-end blends usually have fantastic shape retention, and they are so comfortable.‚Äù Conversely:‚ÄúI \~hate\~ that most jeans now are like 60% cotton, 40% random stuff. They wear out so quickly! What happened to the 98% cotton, 2% elastane ones? Just enough stretch and lasted forever. I can even handle 92% cotton and 8% something else. I just detest‚Ä¶ stretched out after some light use. I expect to‚Ä¶ wash and wear them until the butt wears through.‚Äù
* Some even prefer 100% cotton jeans (doesn‚Äôt start to over-stretch and sag during day as modern poorer-quality jeans. I‚Äôm curvy so this sounds terrible to me!)
* ‚Äú100% wool (sheep's wool, lambswool, mohair) tends to irritate my skin, so I love cashmere, alpaca, merino, or wool blends.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI find that 100% wool and alpaca knits are too itchy, so the blend can actually improve the texture.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúMy favorite so far has been a 96% wool plus 4% synthetic blend. Still has all the feel, drape and durability of wool but with just a little extra stretch. I know that‚Äôs oddly specific but my best quality work clothes are inevitably this blend.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI like wool/nylon blends. Nylon helps strengthen and cuts down on pilling a bit‚Ä¶ I usually knit my own stuff but I go with 25-30% nylon.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúFor knitwear‚Ä¶ I avoid anything made up of more than 3 materials‚Ä¶ more likely to rub against each other and pill more quickly.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThin blended knits will let you down over time.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Pet hair:

* Have to lint roll before laundry, otherwise hair gets on other clothes and causes expensive plumbing repairs. Tumble dry 10 minutes with dryer sheet or balls BEFORE washing to release hair, clean lint trap. Vinegar in fabric softener slot. Moisten dryer balls. Hair starts with pet, brush them.
* Choose smooth, tightly-woven fabrics (no idea how to determine online).
* Dog hair: ‚ÄúI don't buy anything that has lint on it in the store, secondhand or new, because that means it will attract dog hair‚Ä¶ eliminates almost all velvet, corduroy, and other high-pile fabrics. Wool is an iffy one and has to be determined piece by piece.‚Äù
* ‚Äúavoided that outdoorsy fleece material... it‚Äôs impossible to get dog hair off of it‚Äù

&#x200B;

Cotton:

* Easy to find poor quality. Better example brands: arket, kos.
* Pima cotton - longer fiber, softer, durable, luxurious
* Alternatives sustainable: hemp, ramie, linen, tencel
* Opinion: ‚ÄúCotton is best left for underwear and sheets‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI rarely buy cotton or imitation cotton (made from various synthetics like polyester, viscose, rayon - it's more about that t-shirt material look/feel than the actual fabric, as I have excellent luck buying polyester chiffon). These fabrics pill horribly, fade in color, and often attract lint and dog hair. They look new when they are new and never again after that. Poplin cotton is an exception, as I don't tend to have problems with non-stretch, woven cotton items.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúJersey cotton - I mostly buy 100% cotton tees. One of my favourites is made with thick ring-spun cotton. My Grana pima tee is both thin and soft. Probably my most expensive tee is from James Perse and the jersey cotton is so soft and thin and hasn‚Äôt pilled a bit - changed my mind about not spending on tees. I‚Äôve had good luck with LOFT for cheaper tees.‚Äù
* ""Denim (cotton) deserves a shoutout. It's all around one of the sturdiest, best all-around quality, longest-lasting, lowest maintenance materials in existence. It's also easier than many fabrics to mend, and is more resilient to minor damage. It checks all the boxes. Of course it's possible to buy low-quality denim, but I'd rather that than any other low-quality fabric.""
* ""I love cotton poplin or cotton satin for dresses. They're very crisp and smooth, which gives them a more formal or fancy look in my opinion. They also don't wrinkle too much if I pull them out of the washer promptly. For tshirts I like a medium weight ringspun cotton usually, but there are a lot of styles I like. Basically anything except the kind of cheap cotton that quickly grows fuzzy.""

&#x200B;

Wool (sheep), Cashmere (goat), and Mohair (goat), Angora (bunny), Alpaca (alpaca):

* ""Cashmere, lambswool, merino, mohair, angora, alpaca, vicuna, camel, wool crepe, 100% wool blends, wool/acrylic blends. These all have different properties. Personally I can not wear knit lambswool or wool blends due the itch factor. But for some reason, I can wear merino despite it being higher in lanolin, which is associated with itching and skin reaction... Many wool types do not have lanolin, and don't seem to cause as much itching: Alpaca, vicuna, etc.""
* ""Most, if not all, wool is sold in grades. For many, the higher the grade, the longer the fiber, the better the product. You can still buy premium cashmere that is soft as vintage cashmere, but it's incredibly expensive and hard to find. I find that merino wool has a wide range of quality, a lot of low quality merino has flooded the market in the last 2 decades.""
* Wool: ""best known in the fashion industry is the Merino sheep breed, which have extra fluffy soft wool, and the Shetland, which have coarser, tougher fiber. Merino is delicate wool you want next to your skin; Shetland is itchy wool that'll outlast you and possibly your grandkids.""
* ""I like wool especially for outerwear. It's super warm and somewhat waterproof. It's worth investing in a nicer wool though.""
* ""Mohair: from the other goats! Known for a floaty halo of floof around a sturdy strand of yarn, though it does come in other varieties. Shockingly warm, can be a little bit prickly feeling.""
* Cashmere - long lasting and durable, warmer and easier to care for than wool, luxurious, easier. There are grade A through C, A has longest and finest yarn, more ply.
* Cashmere: ""Softer than merino, but also far more expensive, because these particular goats have a pretty limited climate range and also there are a lot more steps between shave goat and get sweater than there are between shave sheep and get sweater.""
* ""Cheaper manufacturers (looking at you Quince) use 100% wool BUT the fibers that make up the wool are shorter and therefore will pill more easily""
* Conversely: ""I own a lot of cashmere of all price ranges, from one of a kind hand knit pieces to fancy vintage stuff to department store brands. I‚Äôve found quince to have significantly better quality than modern department store brands like Bloomingdale‚Äôs, charter club etc. It‚Äôs definitely on the thin side, but it‚Äôs soft and strong and not itchy.""
* ""Angora: from the softest fluffiest bunnies you've ever seen... Similar ""halo"" effect as mohair. Softest fiber on this list, light as air, and insanely warm. Feels like being hugged by the platonic ideal of coziness. Not durable at all, but does well in blends.""
* ""Alpaca: Usually somewhere between Merino wool and cashmere on the softness scale, and warmer than either. Smoother to the touch than either of those fibers. Very drapey, but can have some difficulty holding its shape unless blended with another fiber. While calling it hypoallergenic is a stretch, it is true that some people with allergies to wool and cashmere find they do just fine with alpaca.""
* ""The highest grade of alpaca is called ""baby alpaca."" It's not from babies, it's from the super soft shorter hairs that grow on the chest of alpacas. In Peru, there are a lot of unmarked acrylic/alpaca blends that are sold to tourists as ""baby alpaca."" The joke is that it's ""maybe alpaca."" I've seen similar alpaca/acrylic blends pop up in US malls around Christmas. I'd avoid it. You can get 100% baby alpaca from reputable brands in/imported directly from Peru. It will have a content label on it, and the softness will BLOW YOUR MIND.""

&#x200B;

More on Cashmere (goat):

* ""cashmere farming is also destroyed/ destroying an ecosystem""
* ""My cashmere sweaters are all made in Scotland. They certainly do pill, but Scottish cashmere is supposed to be more durable, and I've found they held up pretty well over time.""
* ‚Äú100% Cashmere sweaters really are worth it imo‚Äù
* ‚ÄúCashmere is very nice but it can be hot and difficult to maintain.‚Äù
* Debate about ethics: ""I wear cashmere on a daily basis and I live in CA. Nothing is comparably soft and breathable for the winter season. It only has to be washed 2-3 times over the whole season compared to cotton which needs to be washed every wear...  if not a cashmere sweater every day... If I weren‚Äôt cold then I‚Äôd to be covered uncomfortable bulk. Furthermore, there are serious ethical considerations regarding cotton as well... cashmere lasts decades... Every thrift store is full of it. There‚Äôs nothing more sustainable/cruelty free than buying secondhand clothes or wearing the clothes you have for decades. ""

&#x200B;

Linen (flax)

* Huge difference between thick versus thin - quality matters here
* Shouldn‚Äôt be sheer, especially trousers
* ‚ÄúCan only compare Uniqlo linen with Massimo Dutti, Rag&Bone, or COS: quality and price are mostly seen in the latter in stuff like buttons (mother of pearl/metal not just plastic), overall more modern cut, and more interesting colors. The cloth itself is almost identical, slightly more polished with a bit more luster in more expensive brands if I‚Äôm being really really picky.‚Äù
* ""I search for linen clothes on resale websites/apps... because I can see how various brands hold up over time and use. Crappy, unedited photos that people post are infinitely times better for seeing how a garment holds up over time than a professional ad photo. Also if you like vintage clothing, the 90s had an absolute field day with linen and there are tonnnssss of clothes out there (on Poshmark, eBay, Mercari, etc.) that are on-trend again.‚Äù
* ""Linen... can be ironed less. If you go for a washed linen with a soft, slightly rumpled look, rather than starched and pressed linen, you can wash and dry it. Immediately remove it from the dryer, and enjoy its softness and loose feel (and warmth from the dryer. It's very cozy).""
* ""Linen... works great for all year, it keeps me cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and I love the way it softens with age. It does wrinkle a lot but I don't really mind, it's quick and easy to iron. I generally go for a pre-softened linen in shirts because I wish to avoid the scratchy phase, even though I know it will get soft.""

&#x200B;

Silk

* ""Silk... is great for thermoregulating... looks very pretty, it can be stiff or soft and slippery depending on the weave and thickness. The downside is it's harder to care for. When I make my own clothes, I generally prewash my silk in water to allow any shrinking or texture changes to happen up front, which makes my life easier later.""
* ‚ÄúSilk jersey is amazing. Slinky, and can be classy and sexy at the same time. Doesn't wrinkle.‚Äù
* ‚Äúsilk twill‚Äù - silk in a thicker, sturdier twill weave. It‚Äôs just all the softness and shine of silk but just enough structure to make collars and cuffs lie sharp and enough thickness/opacity so I don‚Äôt have to worry about anything showing underneath.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Leather and suede:

* ""There's a lot of different kinds of leather. I personally like vegetable-tanned full-grain leather, but it is not suitable for something like a skirt or pants.""

&#x200B;

Understanding semi-synthetic (made from biological materials like trees) products:

* ""Generation 1 - Rayon: sometimes called viscose rayon or artificial silk... high luster and bright shine whilst feeling soft and smooth to wear."" \[Notes: production process is bad for the environment compared to the other two; see below, many people do not like other qualities of rayon\]. ""It was the first regenerated cellulose fibre, patented as ‚Äúartificial silk‚Äù in 1894.""
* ""Generation 2 - Modal: The second generation of cellulose fibre. Its softness has been enhanced and strength has been added to the fabric so that it doesn‚Äôt shrink or stretch when wet."" 1951.
* ""Generation 3 - Lyocell: The latest development in cellulose fabric technology. It‚Äôs better for the environment... retains the softness, drape and potential antibacterial properties of previous generations."" 1990s.
* ""Viscose, modal and lyocell are very similar... might be forgiven for calling them all viscose... man-made but they are not synthetic. In fact, as fibres that are man-made from a natural product, we might call them semi-synthetic fabrics.""
* Tencel is brand name (Green Austrian company) that makes lyocell (from eucalyptus) and modal (beech tree).
* Lyocell ""is one of the most sustainable production processes of any modern material... recovering over 99% of the solvent.. highly energy efficient and powered by bioenergy. The wood... all sustainably sourced and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This has helped Lenzing‚Äôs TENCEL‚Ñ¢ Lyocell gain the ‚ÄúEuropean Award for the Environment‚Äù.""
* ""Modal is usually high in stretch and the fiber is shorter in terms of length than lyocell. Whereas lyocell is the long length fiber which has more bones and shine comparing to modal.Tencel lyocell is the best lyocell and it's the best man-made wood fiber within all kinds.""
* ""Viscose, modal and lyocell are all made from plant material... the fibre itself is composed of long chains of cellulose molecules that have been lined up to make a useful filament (very long continuous fibre), not unlike silk. This plant-based chemical structure is what gives these textiles their desirable properties... natural next-to-skin softness, breathability and good moisture management.""
* """"Lyocell"" = lyocell-rayon cellulose derived from plant materials""Viscose"" = viscose-rayon cellulose derived from plant materials""Modal"" = lyocell/viscose-rayon cellulose derived from beechwood""Bamboo""= lyocell/viscose-rayon cellulose derived from bamboo""
* ""Lyocell: ""the absorption of the water in Tencel¬Æ (lyocell) is more uniform. This internal structure is a product of the different manufacturing process and gives fabrics made from Tencel¬Æ improved moisture absorbency and breathability.""
* Lyocell ""feels and wears infinitely better than other synthetics. It gets a very positive write up on the credible sustainability watchdog sites. Modal and lyocel (maybe also cupro?) also have a quality edge on ordinary viscose and rayon.""
* ""Rayon.. incredibly soft and comfortable to wear and can be easily dyed into whatever colours you desire. Rayon is breathable and wicks moisture from the skin... does not pill... feels gentle on your skin and provides moderate resistance to wrinkling... delicate wash, as it does lose strength when wet. Ironing should be fine but it is less resistant to high temperatures than cotton, so can shrink if tumble dried.""
* ""Modal... same properties as regular rayon but... strength when wet... more soft than rayon, making it ideal for intimate body contact... underwear or sports clothing. The additional strength... machine washable and can be tumble dried without shrinking or stretching... hold their colour well so typically don‚Äôt fade or gray over time.""
* ""lyocell... can absorb moisture around 50% more quickly than cotton and release it into the atmosphere... sports clothes... intimate garments, bedding or sheets... breathable... maintain and regulate body temperature... clothes should stay smelling fresher for longer. This limits the number of times that an item needs to be washed, which is key to dressing more sustainably. In comparison, bacteria are able to thrive on man made synthetics like nylon or polyester. ""
* ""Like modal, lyocell also has the benefit of being durable even when wet. It doesn‚Äôt wrinkle or crease easily, making it a particularly good material to wear if you are one of those people who hates ironing (like me). The versatility of this fabric means it's perfect for anything from light silky flowy dresses, flexible activewear, sheets or even stiffer shirts.""

&#x200B;

Synthetic or sort-of-synthetic materials people liked best:

* ""vastly different levels of quality when it comes to synthetics, and when used deliberately in a garment they can be superior. Fast fashion like Free People or Shein or whatever are going to sell you the garbage quality version, but there are amazing quality plant leathers, polyesters, and so on to be found.""
* Tencel (I believe referring to Lyocell here) are easy to care for, arguably natural/biodegradable rather than strictly synthetic, light and soft, mimic expensive fabrics. ‚ÄúI have a pair of jeans and a chambray shirt in tencel and they're both SO SOFT.‚Äù ‚ÄúTencel, it drapes and washes so nicely!‚Äù ‚ÄùIt doesn‚Äôt wrinkle as much as the cotton Oxford shirts‚Äù
* Modal (beech tree). ‚ÄúFor tees, I like all/mostly cotton (practical, usually comfortable) or modal (sometimes harder to care for but soooo comfy).‚Äù ""IME, modal quality varies widely."" Contrary opinion: ‚ÄúModal bc it stains and rips like a MFer. Or me and the kids are extra hard on clothes?‚Äù
* Spandex. Spandex does not fatigue, stretch, strong, durable, light, soft. Resistant to body oil, perspiration, beach. (A couple contrary opinions: ‚Äúlycra/spandex/elastine. It's basically rubber band thread and will often shorten the life of your clothing because it breaks down more quickly than natural fibers.‚Äù‚ÄúI find even a small amount of spandex to be suffocating, especially in hot weather.‚Äù)
* Nylon. Durable, elastic, resilient, ranges from lustrous to dull. Nylon pills easily, static. ‚ÄúNylon or polyamide is generally better than polyester.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúPolyester and nylon technical fabrics can work if thick.‚Äù Some synthetic if thick- carefully constructed can look good [https://shop-links.co/cjScbV1akd2](https://shop-links.co/cjScbV1akd2)

&#x200B;

The polyester debate:

* Polyester: Durable, easy to care for, good shape retention, lightweight, elastic, strong, crisp and resilient wet or dry, resists wrinkles, dries quickly. Does not absorb moisture well, pills easily, attracts odors. Difficult to iron, but doesn‚Äôt require much ironing. Newer will resist pilling, wick moisture, emulate silk.
* ‚ÄúI frequently buy polyester, particularly chiffon, silk, and satin polyester. Poly has a bad rep for valid reasons (not great for sweat, harmful to the environment), but wearing something for years and never seeing the color fade or the fabric pill, never having to iron it, never needing to dry clean it - those reasons are more than enough for me to claim it as my favorite fabric.‚Äù
* Versus: ‚Äúoften relatively inexpensive, sturdy and easy to care for. However, I tend to dislike the look and feel of most 100% polyester chiffon, crepe, or satin, so i usually won't buy those.‚Äù
* My favourite polyester fabric is the crepe one that Aritzia does - it‚Äôs thick and feels like silk (I pet my pants when I‚Äôm wearing them).
* ‚ÄúPolyester gets an unfair bad rap. There's a polyester like Uniqlo Airism which is light, cool to the skin, breathable, and quick-drying. And there's a Shein polyester blouse that feels like a plastic bag.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúFor polyester, I only buy online if it‚Äôs cheap and easy to return.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI generally only buy polyester for athletic wear.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúPet peeve I absolutely hate polyester scarves. Too shine-y and they do not drape well and they get unknotted. I am not a material snob about everything but with scarves I am. I do not like viscose or modal scarves either, for other reasons, but I hate those a little less than polyester.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúUniqlo has some great polyester fabrics like Airism and Extra Warm Heattech. Most of their cotton is good. I have some of their cotton dresses that I can hang dry and they barely wrinkle. But their silk, linen and rayon is lower quality. My thrifted silk and linen pieces from Talbots are way better quality.‚Äù

&#x200B;

The rayon/viscose debate (VERY NUANCED!)

* Note: while Tencel's modal and lyocell are technically rayon, they are newer, generated far differently (better for environment), and far different structurally (improved properties versus old rayon). When people say ""rayon"" - (including below), they typically are referring to the old (1891) version .
* ""Viscose and rayon are essentially the same thing, but viscose has a longer fiber.""
* ""Never Rayon or viscose"" - wrinkly, twisted hems, terrible after first wash. Unnatural looking wrinkles.
* Rayon: ""Freaking rayon shrinks every time I don't hand wash it but it doesn't have magical odor resistant properties like merino, so it actually needs to be washed pretty often.‚Äù
* ""I hang everything to dry and do laundry 3x/week. It wrinkles if you look at it wrong. Rayon is famous for being literally the most wrinkly fabric aside from linen. It‚Äôs also very structurally weak and prone to wearing out faster.""
* ""I live in the tropics so my ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äúcold‚Äù water is warm at best in the summer. CANNOT TELL YOU how many rayon items have been washed and come out child sized.""
* Conversely: ""I NEVER understand the hate on rayon - in my experience it washes great, doesn't wrinkle, and holds up for a long time. I have rayon shirts and skirts from over five years ago that look brand new. super underrated fabric imo""
* ""Yes, it is a delicate fabric. It does wear out if subject to repeated friction, and it tears easily. So does silk! Delicate fabric is not necessarily bad. It's great for summer because it's very breathable.""
* ""I have very mixed experiences with rayon. Some of it holds up beautifully, but I‚Äôve also had rayon where the color faded after just a few washes and it pilled like crazy.""
* ""I don't wear a lot of rayon, but I prefer rayon or a rayon blend over other silk replacements. I haven't had any problem machine washing it, but I also specifically choose pieces that are labeled machine washable.""
* ""If you don't use a dryer, there will be some creases from the spin cycle. Again, the length of time it is creased plays a role. If you handwash and immediately hang up, or you get it as soon as the washer stops, you can basically smooth out the wrinkles with your hand (except hems on a bias can get twisted). But air dried linen and rayon won't be as soft as it is when it come out of the dryer. If it sits in the washing machine after a spin cycle, the creases will definitely need to be ironed out.""
* ""The vintage rayon slips I have will still last a very long time.""
* ""I love rayon and viscose. The tight weave that looks similar to cotton has a wonderful drape. It holds dye better than cotton. The trick is buying it oversized, then washing it and expecting shrink. Rayon skirts, dresses, and blouses are wonderfully light and breezy in the summer time. Personally I wash it and take it out of the dryer IMMEDIATELY and it doesn't need to be ironed. It only needs ironing if you let it get crumpled in a pile.""
* Viscose - unflattering cling, wrinkles way too much, requires steaming/maintenance.
* Viscose: ‚Äúuseless and flimsy as that ridiculous fabric. It shrinks with any water, reacts poorly to sweat, is probably the least durable material I can think of‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIt has always pilled super quickly for me and it never feels or looks the same after the first wash. Though I'll admit I own a few pieces that are blends‚Ä¶ 25% or less viscose content. They seem to do ok, but I like natural fibers (cotton, wool, linen) much better.‚Äù
* ‚Äùmost of the time steam it before wear, and it will be wrinkly after a few hours.‚Äù

&#x200B;

Synthetics most people recommend against:

* Acrylic - staunch advocates against. Microplastics, do not regulate temperature, ‚ÄúMake a sweater look immediately cheaply made 90% of the time to me. Once you get an eye for acrylic, you‚Äôll know right away.‚Äù ‚Äúmake my hair super staticky‚Ä¶ pill like crazy as soon as they're washed. Hard pass on acrylic sweaters.‚Äù ‚ÄúAcrylic seems to be the worst for pilling and polyester comes a close second. And some wool blends pill.‚Äù‚Äù

background knowledgecaveats

 100 natural is often not better more below
 thicker fabric is better but cotton wool and linen usually good even when thin eg linen jersey knit exception  thick cotton knit sweaters dont feel very warm to me and seem to lose their shape quickly  think this refers more to the knit than the weavefiber  and agree  they tend to look soggy and shapeless on me regardless of how nice on model
 factors that make garment last and hold its shape tighter weave fewer types of fibers mixed in fewer seams not sure how to tell online part of reason lowerquality merino pills and doesn t last  short slender fibers woven loose to be softer  merino is good as long as its decent quality 
 can use quality of stitching to determine if a higher quality fabric  regardless of what the fabric is made of syntheticnaturaletc  french seams properly fashioned buttonholes even hems and a lack of puckeringloose threads  construction is pivotal
 experience  pay attention touch fabrics in stores read tags inspect after taking homewashing
 the same type of fabric or fibers more accurately isn t universal  if youre used to modern mall cashmere vintage cashmere is a revelation 
 stop washing things so much sweaters once a year avoid dryer and hang instead of folding except knits stretch out this is the one exception on how to hang your knits 
  using tap cold water and a more gentle laundry soap not washing clothes after every wear as long as they re still clean 
  i hang dry all my clothes and i attribute this to why i have clothes that have been in and out of heavy rotation without being terribly worse for wear for a decade

natural versus naturalsynthetic blends

 natural is best as a base unless you don t like it  eg wrinkles with linen however good proportion felt that with about 20 synthetic mixed in was more durable keep their shape better less sag over time prevent holesruns extend life
 natural cotton linen some don t like wrinkles wool some don t like itchinesspiling especially looser weaves cashmere piling some don t like care required silk some don t like care required leather some only buy used hemp  ramie  its not that its brittle its that its quite stiff so good for heavier weights pants or skirts that need weight and body or boxy jackets 
  lots of people prefer natural fibers  drape better and are more comfortable less staticky and less prone to odors but there is a huge variation in quality depending on not only fiber length but also construction and thickness 
 most will not buy blends if more than 50 synthetic however the more  wear  it gets socks athletic clothing rain gearouterwear bathing suits and especially technical gear like a rucksack which may be 100 the most synthetic seems acceptable to people however some still avoid polyester anyway because stinky
 good baseline choices  moisture wicking and temperature regulating cottonwoolsilklyocellmodal 
 on ethicsanimal cruelty i think a good balance here as others have already suggested is to buy wool and leather only used stick to cotton denim linen hemp etc when buying new
 caveat  i work as an apparel designer specializing in compression bottoms lots of polyspandex and nylonspandex blends there is no hard and fast rule what will pill and what wont nylon tends to be more durable but it often comes down to the type of knit and how the fibers were created for bottoms we almost exclusively used nylonspandex due to its durability but occasionally would have to use polyspandex if we were sublimating the bottoms the last place i worked had a materials testing lab in house and sometimes a fabric would pass the pillingabrasion tests and then fail in real life situations 

x200b

specific blends

  i like linen and cotton poly blends sometimes as theyre more wrinkleresistant and drape a bit more softly or offer stretch   my favorite shirts are cottonpoly blends as they wear well and don t fade over time  
 conversely  polyestercotton blends pill immediately   pilling is common in poly cotton blends when the cotton starts to separate from the polyester all cotton clothing rarely has this issue  i wouldnt buy poly blend sweatshirts again they pill in the most upsetting way over time
  i like a bit of elastine since i hate fabrics without stretch 
 jeans directly conflicting opinions  for jeans i prefer really soft and stretchy cottonpolyspandex blends higherend blends usually have fantastic shape retention and they are so comfortable  conversely i hate that most jeans now are like 60 cotton 40 random stuff they wear out so quickly what happened to the 98 cotton 2 elastane ones just enough stretch and lasted forever i can even handle 92 cotton and 8 something else i just detest  stretched out after some light use i expect to  wash and wear them until the butt wears through 
 some even prefer 100 cotton jeans doesn t start to overstretch and sag during day as modern poorerquality jeans i m curvy so this sounds terrible to me
  100 wool sheeps wool lambswool mohair tends to irritate my skin so i love cashmere alpaca merino or wool blends 
  i find that 100 wool and alpaca knits are too itchy so the blend can actually improve the texture 
  my favorite so far has been a 96 wool plus 4 synthetic blend still has all the feel drape and durability of wool but with just a little extra stretch i know that s oddly specific but my best quality work clothes are inevitably this blend 
  i like woolnylon blends nylon helps strengthen and cuts down on pilling a bit  i usually knit my own stuff but i go with 2530 nylon 
  for knitwear  i avoid anything made up of more than 3 materials  more likely to rub against each other and pill more quickly 
  thin blended knits will let you down over time 

x200b

pet hair

 have to lint roll before laundry otherwise hair gets on other clothes and causes expensive plumbing repairs tumble dry 10 minutes with dryer sheet or balls before washing to release hair clean lint trap vinegar in fabric softener slot moisten dryer balls hair starts with pet brush them
 choose smooth tightlywoven fabrics no idea how to determine online
 dog hair  i dont buy anything that has lint on it in the store secondhand or new because that means it will attract dog hair  eliminates almost all velvet corduroy and other highpile fabrics wool is an iffy one and has to be determined piece by piece 
  avoided that outdoorsy fleece material it s impossible to get dog hair off of it 

x200b

cotton

 easy to find poor quality better example brands arket kos
 pima cotton  longer fiber softer durable luxurious
 alternatives sustainable hemp ramie linen tencel
 opinion  cotton is best left for underwear and sheets 
  i rarely buy cotton or imitation cotton made from various synthetics like polyester viscose rayon  its more about that tshirt material lookfeel than the actual fabric as i have excellent luck buying polyester chiffon these fabrics pill horribly fade in color and often attract lint and dog hair they look new when they are new and never again after that poplin cotton is an exception as i dont tend to have problems with nonstretch woven cotton items 
  jersey cotton  i mostly buy 100 cotton tees one of my favourites is made with thick ringspun cotton my grana pima tee is both thin and soft probably my most expensive tee is from james perse and the jersey cotton is so soft and thin and hasn t pilled a bit  changed my mind about not spending on tees i ve had good luck with loft for cheaper tees 
 denim cotton deserves a shoutout its all around one of the sturdiest best allaround quality longestlasting lowest maintenance materials in existence its also easier than many fabrics to mend and is more resilient to minor damage it checks all the boxes of course its possible to buy lowquality denim but id rather that than any other lowquality fabric
 i love cotton poplin or cotton satin for dresses theyre very crisp and smooth which gives them a more formal or fancy look in my opinion they also dont wrinkle too much if i pull them out of the washer promptly for tshirts i like a medium weight ringspun cotton usually but there are a lot of styles i like basically anything except the kind of cheap cotton that quickly grows fuzzy

wool sheep cashmere goat and mohair goat angora bunny alpaca alpaca

 cashmere lambswool merino mohair angora alpaca vicuna camel wool crepe 100 wool blends woolacrylic blends these all have different properties personally i can not wear knit lambswool or wool blends due the itch factor but for some reason i can wear merino despite it being higher in lanolin which is associated with itching and skin reaction many wool types do not have lanolin and dont seem to cause as much itching alpaca vicuna etc
 most if not all wool is sold in grades for many the higher the grade the longer the fiber the better the product you can still buy premium cashmere that is soft as vintage cashmere but its incredibly expensive and hard to find i find that merino wool has a wide range of quality a lot of low quality merino has flooded the market in the last 2 decades
 wool best known in the fashion industry is the merino sheep breed which have extra fluffy soft wool and the shetland which have coarser tougher fiber merino is delicate wool you want next to your skin shetland is itchy wool thatll outlast you and possibly your grandkids
 i like wool especially for outerwear its super warm and somewhat waterproof its worth investing in a nicer wool though
 mohair from the other goats known for a floaty halo of floof around a sturdy strand of yarn though it does come in other varieties shockingly warm can be a little bit prickly feeling
 cashmere  long lasting and durable warmer and easier to care for than wool luxurious easier there are grade a through c a has longest and finest yarn more ply
 cashmere softer than merino but also far more expensive because these particular goats have a pretty limited climate range and also there are a lot more steps between shave goat and get sweater than there are between shave sheep and get sweater
 cheaper manufacturers looking at you quince use 100 wool but the fibers that make up the wool are shorter and therefore will pill more easily
 conversely i own a lot of cashmere of all price ranges from one of a kind hand knit pieces to fancy vintage stuff to department store brands i ve found quince to have significantly better quality than modern department store brands like bloomingdale s charter club etc it s definitely on the thin side but it s soft and strong and not itchy
 angora from the softest fluffiest bunnies youve ever seen similar halo effect as mohair softest fiber on this list light as air and insanely warm feels like being hugged by the platonic ideal of coziness not durable at all but does well in blends
 alpaca usually somewhere between merino wool and cashmere on the softness scale and warmer than either smoother to the touch than either of those fibers very drapey but can have some difficulty holding its shape unless blended with another fiber while calling it hypoallergenic is a stretch it is true that some people with allergies to wool and cashmere find they do just fine with alpaca
 the highest grade of alpaca is called baby alpaca its not from babies its from the super soft shorter hairs that grow on the chest of alpacas in peru there are a lot of unmarked acrylicalpaca blends that are sold to tourists as baby alpaca the joke is that its maybe alpaca ive seen similar alpacaacrylic blends pop up in us malls around christmas id avoid it you can get 100 baby alpaca from reputable brands inimported directly from peru it will have a content label on it and the softness will blow your mind

more on cashmere goat

 cashmere farming is also destroyed destroying an ecosystem
 my cashmere sweaters are all made in scotland they certainly do pill but scottish cashmere is supposed to be more durable and ive found they held up pretty well over time
  100 cashmere sweaters really are worth it imo 
  cashmere is very nice but it can be hot and difficult to maintain 
 debate about ethics i wear cashmere on a daily basis and i live in ca nothing is comparably soft and breathable for the winter season it only has to be washed 23 times over the whole season compared to cotton which needs to be washed every wear  if not a cashmere sweater every day if i weren t cold then i d to be covered uncomfortable bulk furthermore there are serious ethical considerations regarding cotton as well cashmere lasts decades every thrift store is full of it there s nothing more sustainablecruelty free than buying secondhand clothes or wearing the clothes you have for decades

linen flax

 huge difference between thick versus thin  quality matters here
 shouldn t be sheer especially trousers
  can only compare uniqlo linen with massimo dutti ragbone or cos quality and price are mostly seen in the latter in stuff like buttons mother of pearlmetal not just plastic overall more modern cut and more interesting colors the cloth itself is almost identical slightly more polished with a bit more luster in more expensive brands if i m being really really picky 
 i search for linen clothes on resale websitesapps because i can see how various brands hold up over time and use crappy unedited photos that people post are infinitely times better for seeing how a garment holds up over time than a professional ad photo also if you like vintage clothing the 90s had an absolute field day with linen and there are tonnnssss of clothes out there on poshmark ebay mercari etc that are ontrend again 
 linen can be ironed less if you go for a washed linen with a soft slightly rumpled look rather than starched and pressed linen you can wash and dry it immediately remove it from the dryer and enjoy its softness and loose feel and warmth from the dryer its very cozy
 linen works great for all year it keeps me cool in the summer and warm in the winter and i love the way it softens with age it does wrinkle a lot but i dont really mind its quick and easy to iron i generally go for a presoftened linen in shirts because i wish to avoid the scratchy phase even though i know it will get soft

x200b

silk

 silk is great for thermoregulating looks very pretty it can be stiff or soft and slippery depending on the weave and thickness the downside is its harder to care for when i make my own clothes i generally prewash my silk in water to allow any shrinking or texture changes to happen up front which makes my life easier later
  silk jersey is amazing slinky and can be classy and sexy at the same time doesnt wrinkle 
  silk twill   silk in a thicker sturdier twill weave it s just all the softness and shine of silk but just enough structure to make collars and cuffs lie sharp and enough thicknessopacity so i don t have to worry about anything showing underneath

leather and suede

 theres a lot of different kinds of leather i personally like vegetabletanned fullgrain leather but it is not suitable for something like a skirt or pants

understanding semisynthetic made from biological materials like trees products

 generation 1  rayon sometimes called viscose rayon or artificial silk high luster and bright shine whilst feeling soft and smooth to wear notes production process is bad for the environment compared to the other two see below many people do not like other qualities of rayon it was the first regenerated cellulose fibre patented as  artificial silk  in 1894
 generation 2  modal the second generation of cellulose fibre its softness has been enhanced and strength has been added to the fabric so that it doesn t shrink or stretch when wet 1951
 generation 3  lyocell the latest development in cellulose fabric technology it s better for the environment retains the softness drape and potential antibacterial properties of previous generations 1990s
 viscose modal and lyocell are very similar might be forgiven for calling them all viscose manmade but they are not synthetic in fact as fibres that are manmade from a natural product we might call them semisynthetic fabrics
 tencel is brand name green austrian company that makes lyocell from eucalyptus and modal beech tree
 lyocell is one of the most sustainable production processes of any modern material recovering over 99 of the solvent highly energy efficient and powered by bioenergy the wood all sustainably sourced and certified by the forest stewardship council fsc this has helped lenzing s tencel  lyocell gain the  european award for the environment 
 modal is usually high in stretch and the fiber is shorter in terms of length than lyocell whereas lyocell is the long length fiber which has more bones and shine comparing to modaltencel lyocell is the best lyocell and its the best manmade wood fiber within all kinds
 viscose modal and lyocell are all made from plant material the fibre itself is composed of long chains of cellulose molecules that have been lined up to make a useful filament very long continuous fibre not unlike silk this plantbased chemical structure is what gives these textiles their desirable properties natural nexttoskin softness breathability and good moisture management
 lyocell  lyocellrayon cellulose derived from plant materialsviscose  viscoserayon cellulose derived from plant materialsmodal  lyocellviscoserayon cellulose derived from beechwoodbamboo lyocellviscoserayon cellulose derived from bamboo
 lyocell the absorption of the water in tencel  lyocell is more uniform this internal structure is a product of the different manufacturing process and gives fabrics made from tencel  improved moisture absorbency and breathability
 lyocell feels and wears infinitely better than other synthetics it gets a very positive write up on the credible sustainability watchdog sites modal and lyocel maybe also cupro also have a quality edge on ordinary viscose and rayon
 rayon incredibly soft and comfortable to wear and can be easily dyed into whatever colours you desire rayon is breathable and wicks moisture from the skin does not pill feels gentle on your skin and provides moderate resistance to wrinkling delicate wash as it does lose strength when wet ironing should be fine but it is less resistant to high temperatures than cotton so can shrink if tumble dried
 modal same properties as regular rayon but strength when wet more soft than rayon making it ideal for intimate body contact underwear or sports clothing the additional strength machine washable and can be tumble dried without shrinking or stretching hold their colour well so typically don t fade or gray over time
 lyocell can absorb moisture around 50 more quickly than cotton and release it into the atmosphere sports clothes intimate garments bedding or sheets breathable maintain and regulate body temperature clothes should stay smelling fresher for longer this limits the number of times that an item needs to be washed which is key to dressing more sustainably in comparison bacteria are able to thrive on man made synthetics like nylon or polyester 
 like modal lyocell also has the benefit of being durable even when wet it doesn t wrinkle or crease easily making it a particularly good material to wear if you are one of those people who hates ironing like me the versatility of this fabric means its perfect for anything from light silky flowy dresses flexible activewear sheets or even stiffer shirts

x200b

synthetic or sortofsynthetic materials people liked best

 vastly different levels of quality when it comes to synthetics and when used deliberately in a garment they can be superior fast fashion like free people or shein or whatever are going to sell you the garbage quality version but there are amazing quality plant leathers polyesters and so on to be found
 tencel i believe referring to lyocell here are easy to care for arguably naturalbiodegradable rather than strictly synthetic light and soft mimic expensive fabrics  i have a pair of jeans and a chambray shirt in tencel and theyre both so soft   tencel it drapes and washes so nicely   it doesn t wrinkle as much as the cotton oxford shirts 
 modal beech tree  for tees i like allmostly cotton practical usually comfortable or modal sometimes harder to care for but soooo comfy  ime modal quality varies widely contrary opinion  modal bc it stains and rips like a mfer or me and the kids are extra hard on clothes 
 spandex spandex does not fatigue stretch strong durable light soft resistant to body oil perspiration beach a couple contrary opinions  lycraspandexelastine its basically rubber band thread and will often shorten the life of your clothing because it breaks down more quickly than natural fibers i find even a small amount of spandex to be suffocating especially in hot weather 
 nylon durable elastic resilient ranges from lustrous to dull nylon pills easily static  nylon or polyamide is generally better than polyester 
  polyester and nylon technical fabrics can work if thick  some synthetic if thick carefully constructed can look good 

x200b

the polyester debate

 polyester durable easy to care for good shape retention lightweight elastic strong crisp and resilient wet or dry resists wrinkles dries quickly does not absorb moisture well pills easily attracts odors difficult to iron but doesn t require much ironing newer will resist pilling wick moisture emulate silk
  i frequently buy polyester particularly chiffon silk and satin polyester poly has a bad rep for valid reasons not great for sweat harmful to the environment but wearing something for years and never seeing the color fade or the fabric pill never having to iron it never needing to dry clean it  those reasons are more than enough for me to claim it as my favorite fabric 
 versus  often relatively inexpensive sturdy and easy to care for however i tend to dislike the look and feel of most 100 polyester chiffon crepe or satin so i usually wont buy those 
 my favourite polyester fabric is the crepe one that aritzia does  it s thick and feels like silk i pet my pants when i m wearing them
  polyester gets an unfair bad rap theres a polyester like uniqlo airism which is light cool to the skin breathable and quickdrying and theres a shein polyester blouse that feels like a plastic bag 
  for polyester i only buy online if it s cheap and easy to return 
  i generally only buy polyester for athletic wear 
  pet peeve i absolutely hate polyester scarves too shiney and they do not drape well and they get unknotted i am not a material snob about everything but with scarves i am i do not like viscose or modal scarves either for other reasons but i hate those a little less than polyester 
  uniqlo has some great polyester fabrics like airism and extra warm heattech most of their cotton is good i have some of their cotton dresses that i can hang dry and they barely wrinkle but their silk linen and rayon is lower quality my thrifted silk and linen pieces from talbots are way better quality 

x200b

the rayonviscose debate very nuanced

 note while tencels modal and lyocell are technically rayon they are newer generated far differently better for environment and far different structurally improved properties versus old rayon when people say rayon  including below they typically are referring to the old 1891 version 
 viscose and rayon are essentially the same thing but viscose has a longer fiber
 never rayon or viscose  wrinkly twisted hems terrible after first wash unnatural looking wrinkles
 rayon freaking rayon shrinks every time i dont hand wash it but it doesnt have magical odor resistant properties like merino so it actually needs to be washed pretty often 
 i hang everything to dry and do laundry 3xweek it wrinkles if you look at it wrong rayon is famous for being literally the most wrinkly fabric aside from linen it s also very structurally weak and prone to wearing out faster
 i live in the tropics so my  cool  or  cold  water is warm at best in the summer cannot tell you how many rayon items have been washed and come out child sized
 conversely i never understand the hate on rayon  in my experience it washes great doesnt wrinkle and holds up for a long time i have rayon shirts and skirts from over five years ago that look brand new super underrated fabric imo
 yes it is a delicate fabric it does wear out if subject to repeated friction and it tears easily so does silk delicate fabric is not necessarily bad its great for summer because its very breathable
 i have very mixed experiences with rayon some of it holds up beautifully but i ve also had rayon where the color faded after just a few washes and it pilled like crazy
 i dont wear a lot of rayon but i prefer rayon or a rayon blend over other silk replacements i havent had any problem machine washing it but i also specifically choose pieces that are labeled machine washable
 if you dont use a dryer there will be some creases from the spin cycle again the length of time it is creased plays a role if you handwash and immediately hang up or you get it as soon as the washer stops you can basically smooth out the wrinkles with your hand except hems on a bias can get twisted but air dried linen and rayon wont be as soft as it is when it come out of the dryer if it sits in the washing machine after a spin cycle the creases will definitely need to be ironed out
 the vintage rayon slips i have will still last a very long time
 i love rayon and viscose the tight weave that looks similar to cotton has a wonderful drape it holds dye better than cotton the trick is buying it oversized then washing it and expecting shrink rayon skirts dresses and blouses are wonderfully light and breezy in the summer time personally i wash it and take it out of the dryer immediately and it doesnt need to be ironed it only needs ironing if you let it get crumpled in a pile
 viscose  unflattering cling wrinkles way too much requires steamingmaintenance
 viscose  useless and flimsy as that ridiculous fabric it shrinks with any water reacts poorly to sweat is probably the least durable material i can think of 
  it has always pilled super quickly for me and it never feels or looks the same after the first wash though ill admit i own a few pieces that are blends  25 or less viscose content they seem to do ok but i like natural fibers cotton wool linen much better 
  most of the time steam it before wear and it will be wrinkly after a few hours 

x200b

synthetics most people recommend against

 acrylic  staunch advocates against microplastics do not regulate temperature  make a sweater look immediately cheaply made 90 of the time to me once you get an eye for acrylic you ll know right away   make my hair super staticky  pill like crazy as soon as theyre washed hard pass on acrylic sweaters   acrylic seems to be the worst for pilling and polyester comes a close second and some wool blends pill 
 avoid acrylic knits  only looks good a few wears  then dingy and misshapen soft warm wool replacement can machine wash spun to replicate cotton do not absorb moisture shrink pill easily resists damagewrinkles dries quickly monoacrylic  fleece or faux fur durable warm pill and mat easily
 conversely  so simons a department store in canada sells acrylic sweaters and winter accessories made of 100 acrylic in germany  10 years ago i treated them like real wool washed in cloth bags air dry no strong agitation they are still in good shape and have developed a soft fuzzy halo like alpaca with minimal pillings a few good winter brands also use acrylic like kombi and bula i guess i got lucky because my positive experience with synthetic fibres is thank to responsible and reputable retailers

its really a shame that one of the most famous examples of american clothing manufacturing is a hot mess its not surprising that their covid response is terrible however i wonder how common this will be with other brands its pretty welldocumented that low wage workers are at a higher risk of contracting covid but most of the coverage ive seen about this is relegated to meat processing plants and amazon warehouses 

everything ive bought online has had a shipping delay  except amazon  because of covid safety procedures does covid safety play a role in your shopping habits are you surprised that dov charney is terrible in a pandemic do you just want people not to relive the fashion underbelly of 20082012 lets discuss",Positive

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,100+ Ethical UK Fashion Brands (including colourful & affordable options),"[Crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalfashion/comments/o2pre7/100_uk_ethical_shops_including_colourful/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) from r/ethicalfashion (with some extra context here) as I thought it might be something that folks here are interested in.

I started moving towards slow fashion last summer, I've been aware of the problems with fast fashion for a while but ultimately seeing that lots of big companies weren't paying garment workers for finished products during the middle of a pandemic really pushed me to give ethical fashion brands another try.

Common complaints about slow fashion are that it's boxy, shapeless and beige. Or, that it's expensive. These were my complaints too. I was determined to find out whether this was actually the case and through a lot of research and lateral thinking, I've found over 100 places to shop for ethical clothing that meet my standards. 

There have been discussions on this sub about ethical fashion being boring and not worth the money. And having come out the other side of this journey, it's just not true, you just have to look a bit harder. 

**To note:**

My priorities are fair wages/labour practices then the environment. Most of these are UK-based, some are European which means they aren't all shipping here right now but will hopefully be able to in the future. Lots of places do ship internationally.

Some indie shops listed don't accept returns which I personally think is an unethical practice and also *illegal* when selling online in the UK but I know some customers don't care if it's a small business so I've included some indie brands I wouldn't personally shop at. 

Mostly women's clothes, cause that's what I wear.

**Disclaimer:** please do your own checks for ethics/sustainability. I usually look for clear pages on websites about sustainability, whether they show transparency on their factories, production line and workers and I often email smaller businesses to see where garments are made.

And to add, despite having all of these options, I still don't shop 100% ethically because these websites are still limited in scope. Ethical activewear brands in the UK don't offer high impact sports bras. I am not interested in bralettes so I won't be buying ethical underwear anytime soon. I'm allergic to wool and nothing fits the trio of cosy, affordable and doesn't irritate my skin better than acrylic so my jumpers are fast fashion. But at least I know I have lots of ethical options to look at first!

ETA: Forgot about Cosabella which actually does have supportive bras, so have added that!

**Disclaimer:** please do your own checks for ethics/sustainability. I usually look for clear pages on websites about sustainability, whether they show transparency on their factories, production line and workers and I often email smaller businesses to see where garments are made.

And to add, despite having all of these options, I still don't shop 100% ethically because these websites are still limited in scope. Ethical activewear brands in the UK don't offer high impact sports bras. I am not interested in bralettes so I won't be buying ethical underwear anytime soon. I'm allergic to wool and nothing fits the trio of cosy, affordable and doesn't irritate my skin better than acrylic so my jumpers are fast fashion. But at least I know I have lots of ethical options to look at first!

ETA: Forgot about Cosabella which actually does have supportive bras, so have added that! Have added a couple new brands and removed a couple according to comments.","100 ethical uk fashion brands including colourful  affordable options crossposting from rethicalfashion with some extra context here as i thought it might be something that folks here are interested in

i started moving towards slow fashion last summer ive been aware of the problems with fast fashion for a while but ultimately seeing that lots of big companies werent paying garment workers for finished products during the middle of a pandemic really pushed me to give ethical fashion brands another try

common complaints about slow fashion are that its boxy shapeless and beige or that its expensive these were my complaints too i was determined to find out whether this was actually the case and through a lot of research and lateral thinking ive found over 100 places to shop for ethical clothing that meet my standards 

there have been discussions on this sub about ethical fashion being boring and not worth the money and having come out the other side of this journey its just not true you just have to look a bit harder 

to note

my priorities are fair wageslabour practices then the environment most of these are ukbased some are european which means they arent all shipping here right now but will hopefully be able to in the future lots of places do ship internationally

some indie shops listed dont accept returns which i personally think is an unethical practice and also illegal when selling online in the uk but i know some customers dont care if its a small business so ive included some indie brands i wouldnt personally shop at 

mostly womens clothes cause thats what i wear

general

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes,"[Way back in 2013 a writer called Buzz Bissinger wrote an article for GQ called ""My Gucci Addiction""](https://www.gq.com/story/buzz-bissinger-shopaholic-gucci-addiction) in which he details how he came, over a period of three years, to develop a shopping addiction that led him to amass an extensive collection of high end fashion, predominantly Gucci, **to the tune of $638,412.97 ($723,738.98 in today's money)**. 

Someone mentioned it on Twitter today so I read it and found a lot of interesting moments to spark a discussion here. The piece **definitely** has a lot of the ""omg lol"" schadenfreude you may expect from the premise of a successful rich white guy with a damaging penchant for luxury fashion; and yet, at least for me, some small moments to empathize with as well, and some opportunities to reflect on the industry and our relationship with it as consumers.

Some choice quotes:

**In which the cachet of designer branding provides an avenue for safe experimentation:**

>The self-expression feels glorious, an indispensable part of me. As a  stranger said after admiring my look in a Gucci burgundy jacquard  velvet jacket and a Burberry black patent leather trench, ""You don't  give a fuck.""  
>  
>I don't. I finally don't.

(This made me think about how sometimes, when experimenting with new looks, it feels ""safer"" to go with something that is name brand, as though that provides a defense against anyone judging you for wearing it.  And also about the people I know who truly don't give a fuck, who perform these transgressions in a way that feels ""authentic"": performers in the drag and burlesque scene, art-punk kids, budding designers who draft their own clothes...)

**When fashion becomes an act of resistance against societal and cultural expectations:**

>Think it's easy to be different in America? Try something as benign as  wearing stretch leather leggings or knee-high boots if you are a man.

**The inner monologue of a luxury addict:**

>I have to have it. I don't have to have it. I need it. I don't need it. I  can afford it. I can't afford it. It is the cycle familiar to anyone  who fetishizes high fashion.

**The relatable moment for quarantine over-spenders:**

>My most anticipated sound became the ringing of the doorbell. It meant  the UPS man was here, or the FedEx man, or the DHL man, bringing the  goods.

**On the feeling of commitment that can come with declaring a public interest in fashion (that it invites judgment and therefore you need to 'level up' everything to pass the bar):** 

>Everything else I am wearing‚Äîthe jacket, the pants, the scarf, the  boots‚Äîhas been chosen in careful consultation with my sales associate at  the Gucci flagship store in New York, whom I think of as the Divine  Stylist, except for the Jockey shorts. I went out on a limb and chose  those all by myself: I should have gone with Calvin Klein or nothing at  all. My God, what was I thinking?

The hook to the piece was (being the early 2010s) that Bissinger is male and (ostensibly) straight and a sportswriter, and therefore it's implied that there's something quite deviant about both his fashion interest and shopping addiction. Bissinger seems to somewhat enjoy the feeling that his clothing attracts attention and confusion for these reasons; there's a sense that he feels a lot of overwhelming anxiety about his identity or his desirability or his image, and that fashion is the quick fix. 

There's a constant whiplash through the essay between moments of insight and reflection that verge on relatable, and long paragraphs of justification, or pomposity, or pure rich guy shit that feel obtuse and uncomfortable to read. 

There's the sections where he examines desire, desirability, sex, and sexuality, all of which have intertwining roles in fashion - but I'm not sure that sex tourism in Macao is an ethical way to explore those things. 

And ofc I don't think we can talk about spending $638k on Gucci without dropping the goods (I really wish there were more pictures):

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,A few thoughts on the strange phenomenon of influencers turning into fashion designers,"So, today Justine Leconte's new clothing line dropped. I like Justine for her fashion intro and history videos, but I still think she has zero fashion sensibilities when it comes to design and creativity.

[This](https://www.justineleconte.com/shop) is her new line of clothes.

I think the clothes have very little engagement with current trends and styles. They are not even flattering on the model herself - they come from the hands of someone who doesn't know how clothes should fit on bodies. That sweater dress with the zigzag green pattern looks like something my aunt made back in the 90s, before she became good at knitting.

I give credit for her attempt to create a clothing line from scratch and for paying attention to ethics and sustainability - and it's not easy. And I'm sure her fans would drop 200 euros on a shapeless tee made of lyocell. That's what influencers are for - make you buy things you don't need.

However, I do sometimes enjoy looking at the fashion lines created by other influencers. I think Chriselle Lim's clothes are very nice. The designs are very good, but it makes me wonder how much of the clothing line is her own creation. She might be involved in the choice of patterns and shapes, but the actual design might have been done by some agency not too dissimilar to H&M, etc.

Her line is pretty good, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwjtFAP95Iw) is a video of it. But most of her items are made of polyester and other synthetic fabrics - so not warm for winter at all.

Another influencer who has created a ""fashion line"" is Meghan Ellaby. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDF5yJbSw5I) is a video of her line of sweaters. I would describe Meghan's fashion sense as unbridled and thoughtless maximalism. Despite not liking her style, I did enjoy her sweaters - they are cute and a good buy for her fans.

So have you guys found other fashion lines from influencers? What do you think of them?",1545077345.0,"A few thoughts on the strange phenomenon of influencers turning into fashion designers So, today Justine Leconte's new clothing line dropped. I like Justine for her fashion intro and history videos, but I still think she has zero fashion sensibilities when it comes to design and creativity.

[This](https://www.justineleconte.com/shop) is her new line of clothes.

I think the clothes have very little engagement with current trends and styles. They are not even flattering on the model herself - they come from the hands of someone who doesn't know how clothes should fit on bodies. That sweater dress with the zigzag green pattern looks like something my aunt made back in the 90s, before she became good at knitting.

I give credit for her attempt to create a clothing line from scratch and for paying attention to ethics and sustainability - and it's not easy. And I'm sure her fans would drop 200 euros on a shapeless tee made of lyocell. That's what influencers are for - make you buy things you don't need.

However, I do sometimes enjoy looking at the fashion lines created by other influencers. I think Chriselle Lim's clothes are very nice. The designs are very good, but it makes me wonder how much of the clothing line is her own creation. She might be involved in the choice of patterns and shapes, but the actual design might have been done by some agency not too dissimilar to H&M, etc.

Her line is pretty good, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwjtFAP95Iw) is a video of it. But most of her items are made of polyester and other synthetic fabrics - so not warm for winter at all.

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,Environmental Guilt from Online Ordering,"Hi everyone! I have always enjoyed seeing the conversations about ethics in fashion on this sub.  This year, I found myself feeling disgusted at how much online ordering I do, how much my neighbors do, and I have been thinking it can‚Äôt be good for the environment. 

I had my wedding this Fall and while less than 20% of guests used my tiny registry, we still had a floor to ceiling mountain of packaging/bubble wrap from it!  After Black Friday, so many packages arrived for people (including myself), the recycling and trash bags on the sidewalk were taller than a large adult man.

Additionally when China announced it‚Äôs not accepting the world‚Äôs trash anymore (hyperbole on my part) we have countries unsure of what to do with all the crap we consumed and threw out, recycling or otherwise. 

I don‚Äôt know what it is about this year that it clicked to me. It‚Äôs not like these piles are anything new, it happens every Dec. But this year I‚Äôm grossed out and I want to make a conscious effort now and through 2019 to stop doing lazy online ordering. Anything I could walk in to a nearby store for, near my work or home, I need to do it. I understand there are some things you just can‚Äôt get local - for example I need wide shoes and most stores don‚Äôt even have that in stock to try. So I feel stuck having to order online for that.

I‚Äôm looking to buy a mechanical keyboard soon and I definitely need to order online for the one I‚Äôm getting. But I‚Äôve been a lazy asshole about buying STUFF and I can reduce.

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,I made a giant excel spreadsheet with all my clothes because I am a self-proclaimed fashion nerd,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I have been into fashion for a long time, and I have also been into color & style system for a long time. I am in my early mid-twenties now and somewhat ""settling"" into my likes & dislikes as well as having the need to start acquiring a more sense-making, versatile, professional wardrobe.

I have also studied fashion (I am jobsearching and it is up in the air whether I will actually get a job in the industry), and I sew a lot of my own clothes due to having a harder-to-fit bodytype and somewhat niche taste. I have also had a lot of mweh sewing assignments for school in the past. These assignments ranged from ""you need to use this type of fabric and you need to sew this style. You can choose the print/color and you can choose one of those non-inclusive standardizes sizes, though"" to ""do whatever. Just make it a weird challenging specific garment you'll never wear"" (i.e. I am in the possesion of a jarretel/lingerie suspenders thing. I don't wear those. Not included in the chart because of ""underwear strictly"" category), so I have a bunch of ill-fitting, meh-styled sewing assignments idk what to do with. They're brandless and unfashionable styles, therefore unsellable, I find it weird to bring self-made clothes to a thrift store for donation, and my ""to upcycle"" box is already overflowing.

On top of that, I was very deep into ""sustainable fashion"" for a while in my late teens (17 - 19). In a rather extreme way; exclusively thrifting and buying from supposed ethical brands, but without the sewing skills. This actually let me to buying some clothes I didn't 100% like, and I limited myself quite a lot for a while. I was a whiny little brat tbh, verbally slapping people for daring to enter a Zara. It has gotten a bit less extreme, but because of the obvious issues in the fashion industry I still don't buy a lot of fast fashion even *if I just really forking need something* and feel guilty about throwing away clothes, such as some clothes I've had since before that period but are unsellable and synthetic and I don't want them to end up in places where they might do harm or I do an attempt at ""fixing"" them first, with mixed results.

&#x200B;

***TL;DR: I have a quite messy wardrobe that despite my efforts is the good old ""having lots of clothes yet nothing to wear""***

&#x200B;

I haven't included everything - I have a box with a bunch of clothes that are currently listed on vinted, a bunch of ""to upcycle"" in my sewing room and I also didn't bother including things like pyjamas, swimwear and underwear, as well as bags because I have very few with just different practical purposes (I have pre-made the category in case this changes)

Here is the link:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1\_UItVexsho8UizbxxwkKwWMtf54p36sYLf4gKphBpsk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_UItVexsho8UizbxxwkKwWMtf54p36sYLf4gKphBpsk/edit?usp=sharing)

Most items link to a picture, either my public instagram or imgur (most of the time)

In the first page is some general info about me, in the second page is the clothes listing.

It looks like a coloring book, I am aware. I tried to include as much info as possible in color-coded ways, and because I have a lot of colors in my wardrobe but tend to dress quite tonally, showing what color it is is also important.

I also wrote down my thoughts on everything, and will start including the wears from yesterday onwards (my birthday was yesterday, so good starting point IMO) as well as the price for newly-added items (or estimated price for new DIY things)

Some of the ""no"" listed clothes are actually already in the resell box or finally in the garage to get to a clothing recycling bin, as there is a bit since having finished the bulk of the spreadsheet and me making this post. I also made a order of 4 versatile-looking tops on secondhand site sellpy (see my profile), and have some sewing project ideas for certain other holes.

Overall, it was a very helpful exercise for me. It helped me realize I have a lot of clothes (though likely fewer than many) and need to get my shirt together lol, but also have a lot of things I don't have. **Like, I literally \*do not have\* what my equivalent of light blue jeans would be, or a dark suit, or a LBD, or a white shirt.**

***So, my main takeaways:***

* I need more dresses. I like wearing dresses, they're easy, I am wearing one right now (grey woolblend fine knit ruffled neckline number), but I don't have a lot of them due to the general connotation of ""fancy"" while having a casual lifestyle (not that that stops me though), dresses needing to fit well across the whole body, the currently or previously easy to find styles rarely being my vibe, and them using more fabric so I can't just whip them up as quickly. Getting a couple of multi-seasonal (or very, very practical one season) versatile dresses in very good or neutral colors is definitely a goal.
* Most of the time, it is about 12¬∞C and cloudy here. Literally; it has been that exact weather with a few days/weeks of variation since october now, and the only difference between a warm winter day and a cool summer day is the amount of daylight. Yet, ""transitional multiseasonal on the chillier side"" is not the vast, vast majority of my clothes. I particularly need more warmer knit but not thick sweater longsleeve tops that I genuinely like and more bottoms that are close to ""jeans"" vibewise but aren't (I find jeans specifically to often be uncomfortable, hard to fit/make and the blues are rarely good on me) such as a dark grey twill pant.
* I need more good knitwear. I can sew but can hardly knit or crochet, so making fancy beaded jackets as ""layers"" has been my cop-out, but no matter whether I will still be at home for a while or get some business casual desk job, good somewhat elevated sweaters are welcome.
* I need to put a stop to my tendency to do endless thrift flips and upcycles, turning everything into a tailored beaded corset top (because it uses little fabric) from unwashable or synthetic (sweaty) fabrics. I specifically don't need more blue-ish formal-ish summery tops. And I have fabric for at least 3 more of these (which are, you guess it, fabric scraps and upcycles)
* And, as previously mentioned, I should start looking into what my versions of certain ""wardrobe basics"" are. I could frankly really use a dark neutral suit for job interviews, a dark versatile multiseasonal dress for when I don't know what to wear and don't want to stand out to much at events, ""simple fabric"" trousers neutral that fit well, a professional looking light neutral blouse, etc.

I hope this can be interesting or inspiring to people!

I could frankly really use a dark neutral suit for job interviews, a dark versatile multiseasonal dress for when I don't know what to wear and don't want to stand out to much at events, ""simple fabric"" trousers neutral that fit well, a professional looking light neutral blouse, etc.

I hope this can be interesting or inspiring to people!

The initial spreadsheet format was copied from a friend's version, but I added more categories and info.","i made a giant excel spreadsheet with all my clothes because i am a selfproclaimed fashion nerd hello

x200b

i have been into fashion for a long time and i have also been into color  style system for a long time i am in my early midtwenties now and somewhat settling into my likes  dislikes as well as having the need to start acquiring a more sensemaking versatile professional wardrobe

i have also studied fashion i am jobsearching and it is up in the air whether i will actually get a job in the industry and i sew a lot of my own clothes due to having a hardertofit bodytype and somewhat niche taste i have also had a lot of mweh sewing assignments for school in the past these assignments ranged from you need to use this type of fabric and you need to sew this style you can choose the printcolor and you can choose one of those noninclusive standardizes sizes though to do whatever just make it a weird challenging specific garment youll never wear ie i am in the possesion of a jarretellingerie suspenders thing i dont wear those not included in the chart because of underwear strictly category so i have a bunch of illfitting mehstyled sewing assignments idk what to do with theyre brandless and unfashionable styles therefore unsellable i find it weird to bring selfmade clothes to a thrift store for donation and my to upcycle box is already overflowing

on top of that i was very deep into sustainable fashion for a while in my late teens 17  19 in a rather extreme way exclusively thrifting and buying from supposed ethical brands but without the sewing skills this actually let me to buying some clothes i didnt 100 like and i limited myself quite a lot for a while i was a whiny little brat tbh verbally slapping people for daring to enter a zara it has gotten a bit less extreme but because of the obvious issues in the fashion industry i still dont buy a lot of fast fashion even if i just really forking need something and feel guilty about throwing away clothes such as some clothes ive had since before that period but are unsellable and synthetic and i dont want them to end up in places where they might do harm or i do an attempt at fixing them first with mixed results

x200b

tldr i have a quite messy wardrobe that despite my efforts is the good old having lots of clothes yet nothing to wear

x200b

i havent included everything  i have a box with a bunch of clothes that are currently listed on vinted a bunch of to upcycle in my sewing room and i also didnt bother including things like pyjamas swimwear and underwear as well as bags because i have very few with just different practical purposes i have premade the category in case this changes

here is the link



most items link to a picture either my public instagram or imgur most of the time

in the first page is some general info about me in the second page is the clothes listing

it looks like a coloring book i am aware i tried to include as much info as possible in colorcoded ways and because i have a lot of colors in my wardrobe but tend to dress quite tonally showing what color it is is also important

i also wrote down my thoughts on everything and will start including the wears from yesterday onwards my birthday was yesterday so good starting point imo as well as the price for newlyadded items or estimated price for new diy things

some of the no listed clothes are actually already in the resell box or finally in the garage to get to a clothing recycling bin as there is a bit since having finished the bulk of the spreadsheet and me making this post i also made a order of 4 versatilelooking tops on secondhand site sellpy see my profile and have some sewing project ideas for certain other holes

overall it was a very helpful exercise for me it helped me realize i have a lot of clothes though likely fewer than many and need to get my shirt together lol but also have a lot of things i dont have like i literally do not have what my equivalent of light blue jeans would be or a dark suit or a lbd or a white shirt

so my main takeaways

 i need more dresses i like wearing dresses theyre easy i am wearing one right now grey woolblend fine knit ruffled neckline number but i dont have a lot of them due to the general connotation of fancy while having a casual lifestyle not that that stops me though dresses needing to fit well across the whole body the currently or previously easy to find styles rarely being my vibe and them using more fabric so i cant just whip them up as quickly getting a couple of multiseasonal or very very practical one season versatile dresses in very good or neutral colors is definitely a goal
 most of the time it is about 12 c and cloudy here literally it has been that exact weather with a few daysweeks of variation since october now and the only difference between a warm winter day and a cool summer day is the amount of daylight yet transitional multiseasonal on the chillier side is not the vast vast majority of my clothes i particularly need more warmer knit but not thick sweater longsleeve tops that i genuinely like and more bottoms that are close to jeans vibewise but arent i find jeans specifically to often be uncomfortable hard to fitmake and the blues are rarely good on me such as a dark grey twill pant
 i need more good knitwear i can sew but can hardly knit or crochet so making fancy beaded jackets as layers has been my copout but no matter whether i will still be at home for a while or get some business casual desk job good somewhat elevated sweaters are welcome
 i need to put a stop to my tendency to do endless thrift flips and upcycles turning everything into a tailored beaded corset top because it uses little fabric from unwashable or synthetic sweaty fabrics i specifically dont need more blueish formalish summery tops and i have fabric for at least 3 more of these which are you guess it fabric scraps and upcycles
 and as previously mentioned i should start looking into what my versions of certain wardrobe basics are i could frankly really use a dark neutral suit for job interviews a dark versatile multiseasonal dress for when i dont know what to wear and dont want to stand out to much at events simple fabric trousers neutral that fit well a professional looking light neutral blouse etc

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,How To Add Visual Interest To Summer Outfits,"One question that pops up incredibly often on this sub once high temperatures hit is how to make warm weather wear looks‚Ä¶interesting. The disconnect seems to occur because for fall/winter dressing, there is more texture and more layering to play with, so it‚Äôs easier to create an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù rather than just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù. When you‚Äôre only wearing one layer, that becomes more difficult and the outfit you‚Äôre trying to put together can leave something to be desired, as it‚Äôs plain and stripped back. 


But you don‚Äôt have to layer 3 types of clothes in order to maintain style going into the warmer months. Warm weather has endless opportunities for fashionable dressing, and in the glorious absence of a big coat that covers up all your hard work, you‚Äôre free to show off an outfit that plays with colors, proportions, textures, patterns, or interesting accessories. 


I know summer is technically on its way out, but a lot of us still have at least a month or two of hot weather to go, so let‚Äôs take a look at putting together some cool summer outfits. 





# Color





Perhaps more than anything else, warm weather is an excellent opportunity to enjoy color. While no one‚Äôs stopping you from wearing colorful clothes in the winter, it‚Äôs clear that cold weather tends to be a sad mass of black - mostly for practical reasons. 


But when the sun is shining and there are no coats covering up your outfit, you can bring out the yellows, the pinks, the greens - and they can be the key to taking your attire from just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù to an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 







## color blocking




Color blocking is a tried and true method to add visual interest. Color in an outfit always brings it up a step, but color blocking requires more skill, and more attention paid to silhouette, as well as color pairings. You can opt for colors opposite on the color wheel, or just colors that feel right to you - there are no rules, as long as you love the result.

##pop of color




Opting for just a pop of color can be a great way to make your outfit more fun, but without the difficulty of pairing colors together. The easiest way to do it is to add a colorful bag to an otherwise neutral outfit. A lavender bag can give a little contrast to a basic white dress and elevate it to an outfit. Especially if you‚Äôre also pairing it with a colorful pair of shoes. Matching shoes are fine, but an even more interesting choice is a pair of shoes in a complementary color.

## monochrome



Probably a lot of us have worn all-black before, but how many have tried the same in a different color? What is boring and safe in black becomes infinitely more stylish and interesting in a bold color that goes great with a tan. Think about an all pink outfit and what a statement it makes. It‚Äôs still really easy to put together - you‚Äôre only using one color - and yet, it‚Äôs anything but boring.

##tonal dressing



Pairing colors together can be tricky and it‚Äôs often a barrier of entry to fashion for the regular person. But there are easy, somewhat prescriptive ways to do it, like tonal dressing. Not quite monochrome, tonal dressing is more about picking different shades of the same base color or color palette. Adjacent colors, if you will. Both a step above monochrome, and easier than finding identical shades to match, tonal dressing is more visually exciting than a monochromatic outfit, while still being a subtle way to do color.

# Pattern




Perhaps an obvious suggestion, pattern pulls an outfit right out of its boring, solid color nothingness and gives it purpose, it gives it oomph, it gives it visual interest. Where things really get interesting is when you pattern match - or clash. But that‚Äôs a somewhat ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù lesson. For now, even something as simple as choosing a floral skirt instead of a solid colored one can make your clothes an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 




## floral




Yes, yes, florals for spring are not groundbreaking. But we have to walk before we can run. Florals are common, and they‚Äôre easy. A very seasonally-appropriate pattern for spring-summer, it adds a touch of whimsy and femininity to an otherwise simple outfit.

## polka dots & stripes




Polka dots and stripes are other classic patterns you can‚Äôt really go wrong with. They typically still come in neutral colors, for the most part, but you can also find them in more fun colors if you don‚Äôt want to stick to boring black and white.

## abstract




Then, of course, we‚Äôve got the cooler, more modern abstract prints. Paint splotches, random shapes, approximations of faces - anything goes. Why wear a basic white shirt, when you can wear an interesting one?

## gingham




Gingham is a classic summer staple. Casual and light, it‚Äôs a quintessential ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù print. Black and white gingham is a good neutral option, but if you want something more fun, any pastel color + white is very summery while still maintaining visual interest.

## pattern clashing




Of course, the ultimate way to wear pattern is to clash it against more pattern. A higher difficulty task, but with a big visual reward, pattern clashing can make even the most boring, basic outfit look elevated.

# Texture






When you‚Äôve not got many pieces to work with for an outfit, those pieces have to work much harder to be interesting, to stand out, to be ‚Äúworthy‚Äù. In comes texture. An outfit that‚Äôs cotton from top to bottom is not much of an outfit. It‚Äôs plain, flat, and boring. Mixing silk and organza, however, becomes an event. 






## linen/cotton
Linen and cotton are the fabrics of choice for many during the summer. It‚Äôs easy to see why - they keep you cool, they feel nice, and they‚Äôre easy to find on the highstreet at decent prices. Plus, they tend to last - if slightly discolored from the sun. A good basis that you can add to.

## sheer (tulle, gauze, organza)




Sheer is having a huge moment, and now is the time to take full advantage. Despite it being mainly synthetic fabrics, the thinness, sheerness, volume and lightweight quality of these fabrics means they can be easily worn during the height of summer without fear of heatstroke. Beautiful, diaphanous, and eminently *special*, a sheer element can bring the whimsy you need for a wedding outfit, the femininity to a date outfit, or that special je n‚Äôest ce quoi to a simple brunch outfit.

## silk




Silk is in no way as fanciful as it‚Äôs touted to be, and it has the excellent advantage of being a great light-weight option for hot weather. Especially if you need something special or formal, there‚Äôs nothing better than silk. It looks amazing, it‚Äôs cool, and it packs small. 





[silk 1](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f924d19f7456d89b10b40f/1600694299266-G51G911O4WK09YVYWOHI/11+Honore+Fall+Styles)

## seersucker



A quintessential summer fabric if there ever was one, seersucker is great for a variety of clothes. Since it‚Äôs so light, it allows you to wear more formal or covered up garments, such as an elegant seersucker suit that would be hot in any other fabric. 




[seersucker 1](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ppkMIfMKA8A/WRu6WZr0T7I/AAAAAAAAXmc/fwbxEejfy1ciW1iw4xBaVr7Xg4lab4XNACEw/s1600/eloquii%2Bseersuker%2Bdress%2B%2Bboater%2Bhat%2Bplus%2Bsize%2Boutfit.jpg)

##muslin




With a slightly ‚Äúcrinkled‚Äù texture, muslin is casual in nature, and it brings visual interest all on its own. Sure, it may not be ideal for a sleek outfit, but it‚Äôs perfect for a billowy sleeveless dress when it‚Äôs too hot to put anything else on, but you still want it to look ~interesting~.

# Proportions & silhouette 





My personal favorite, playing with proportion and silhouette is a subtle and sophisticated way to create An Outfit if you‚Äôre not into accessorizing or it‚Äôs too hot to pile on the necklaces. Structural and sleek, this type of outfit allows shapes to speak for themselves and become the main event, with minimal other distractions. 





## loose on loose



There is no better season to do loose on loose than summer, especially if you prefer not to show skin. As cute as tight dresses are, this is not the time to pull them out. Instead, a pair of cropped wide leg pants can work surprisingly well with a boxy shirt with billowy sleeves. The silhouette is interesting on its own, you don‚Äôt have fabric touching your skin, and you‚Äôre not getting sunburned. All in all, 10/10 summer outfit.

## tight on loose




That isn‚Äôt to say that we can‚Äôt do tight + loose in hot weather, you just have to be more strategic about it. It‚Äôs still a visually interesting silhouette, but in the summer, the tight element should be the top, paired with a looser skirt or pair of pants. A bodycon tanktop or crop top with a pair of high-waisted linen shorts is as elegant as it is cooling.

## structural/architectural detailing 





Sometimes, a single piece with strong architectural detailing can bring all the pizzazz you need. In recent years, with the ushering in of maximalist tendencies, there‚Äôs been no shortage of interesting structural details on summer clothes. A short, but wonderfully voluminous dress is both a statement and a clever way to stay cool. Same with very wide pants, a long column silhouette, intense pleating on a skirt, or an interesting neckline. Unexpected accessories like very chunky shoes paired with a very short dress or a very small purse with a voluminous outfit can also provide that extra kick.

# Interesting details




Seemingly small details can go a long way in elevating a piece, so don‚Äôt discount the power that beading can have, straps, buckles, or even buttons. Some of these details will work better for evening than daytime, but it entire depends on your style, the type of embellishment, and the occasion. Daytime sequins are acceptable outside of Vegas now, I‚Äôm just saying. 






## embellishment




Simple shapes can still look amazing, if you add a little bling. The addition of sequins, rhinestones, or intricate beading can turn a forgettable dress into something special. The best part is that this can be DIY-ed, especially if you have a dress you‚Äôre a little tired of or that is a tad boring. You can be as restrained or as crazy as you want with your embellishments. Pearl straps, bejeweled necklines, or full sequinned pieces - they‚Äôre always a show-stopper.

## straps



With enough sunscreen, or a disregard for unconventional tan lines, something as simple as strap placement can make an outfit more interesting. Very strappy tops are very in right now, as are tops and dresses with open backs with special detailing, like tie-backs, bows, or cut-outs in different shapes.

## buckles, knots, pleating, buttons





Other distinct visual details that can also be utilitarian also help draw the eye, add some contrast, and zuzh up your outfit. Whether it‚Äôs a simple row of contrasting buttons, some statement hardware in the form of a special belt buckle, or gorgeous pleating, these details can say a lot without trying too hard.

# Accessories


Sometimes, the easiest way to do it is just to add accessories. It requires less fussing, and you don‚Äôt have to think as much about them. The biggest bonus here is that accessories rarely make you hotter, but they can still have a huge visual impact and totally ‚Äúmake‚Äù an outfit. 



## textured/colorful/big or small bag




A bag should never be an afterthought, but that‚Äôs especially important to remember when putting together summer outfits. Because you have fewer elements to play with, each of them becomes more important and ‚Äúweighs‚Äù more in the overall structure of your look. 


A very big or very small bag is a tried and true way to bring the unexpected, but you can also achieve a similar effect if you pick a bag that is colorful, or that‚Äôs textured. Consider giving your black leather bags a rest, and instead, enjoying wicker baskets, wooden bags, braided bags, and other unique textures or shapes. Summer is the time for the novelty bag to shine.

## interesting shoes - size, color, heel shape, embellishments




Of course, shoes are also essential. Not just because you literally cannot create an outfit without them, but because they can also weigh heavily in the balance of your outfit. Luckily for us, statement shoes are in, and there‚Äôs plenty to play with in terms of features. Chunky shoes are du jour, but there are also very strappy shoes out there, interesting heel shapes, high platforms, shiny embellishments, and shockingly neon colors.

## hats 



If you‚Äôve ever wished you could wear hats, but were afraid you‚Äôd look like an asshole, now is your time. You have plausible deniability, hats are not just stylish, but they‚Äôre useful, or even necessary, if you live somewhere where the sun is particularly oppressive. Shout out to Australia, the skin cancer capital of the world. 


A straw hat can complete an outfit or push it towards a certain vibe. Chic Gondolier with a breton tee and black shorts? Add a hat. Jungle Adventurer dressed head to toe in new-wave Banana Republic? Add a hat. Baptist Church Lady-core with a ruffly floral dress? Add a hat.

# Third Piece



The third piece is, of course, a basic ‚Äúrule‚Äù for outfit creation, but hot weather makes it just a little bit more difficult, when even one layer of clothing feels like too much to bear. Thankfully, you can ‚Äúcheat‚Äù and still add your third piece, but without adding extra bulk on top of an outfit you‚Äôre already overheating in. 






## linen blazer




For evenings and A/C environments, a linen blazer is very versatile and makes almost any outfit better. It works great with little dresses, shorts, wide leg linen pants - it flatters elegant outfits and beautifully contrasts more casual ones. You really can‚Äôt go wrong, and you also can‚Äôt overheat.

## vests




A more summer-y version of the blazer, the vest is not just very fashionable at the moment, it‚Äôs also the perfect layering piece. Adding minimal bulk, but maximum visual interest, a vest can be paired with anything, from dresses to shirts & shorts, to wearing it by itself as a top. The vest + shorts or vest + pleated pants combo reigns supreme for the spring/summer season; it‚Äôs sophisticated, a little masculine, and a nice departure from typical summer outfits.

## fanny pack/cross body



Any bag can make a good third piece, as we‚Äôve discussed, but a fanny pack worn crossbody is more visible, in many ways, it‚Äôs very cool, and it can be very flattering. Worn on top of a straighter, looser, or more billowy top or dress, it creates some necessary shaping, while still maintaining the casual vibe. Wear it in a contrasting color or interesting texture for maximum effect.

## maximalist jewelry



Jewelry may be the easy way out, but one cannot deny the effect of a truly big-ass pair of earrings with an otherwise simple outfit. Necklaces, rings, and bracelets are not to be ignored, and can also work beautifully to accent an outfit or your great tan, but earrings have the advantage of not touching your skin and they also bring attention to your face, and look great with your hair up - a must, in hot weather.

# What's the bottom line?


Summer dressing can be just as fun as dressing for cooler weather, just in a different way. Layering is not the only way to create something that feels like An Outfit, and sophistication and visual interest are completely achievable in hot weather, even while remaining cool. The examples shown here aren‚Äôt meant to be a rulebook to follow, but serve more as inspiration for your own wardrobe and can hopefully give you some ideas on ways to fall in love with your summer wardrobe.

https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11m7yxr/updating_an_outdated_wardrobe_part_2_office_wear/",1692543078.0,"How To Add Visual Interest To Summer Outfits One question that pops up incredibly often on this sub once high temperatures hit is how to make warm weather wear looks‚Ä¶interesting. The disconnect seems to occur because for fall/winter dressing, there is more texture and more layering to play with, so it‚Äôs easier to create an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù rather than just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù. When you‚Äôre only wearing one layer, that becomes more difficult and the outfit you‚Äôre trying to put together can leave something to be desired, as it‚Äôs plain and stripped back. 


But you don‚Äôt have to layer 3 types of clothes in order to maintain style going into the warmer months. Warm weather has endless opportunities for fashionable dressing, and in the glorious absence of a big coat that covers up all your hard work, you‚Äôre free to show off an outfit that plays with colors, proportions, textures, patterns, or interesting accessories. 


I know summer is technically on its way out, but a lot of us still have at least a month or two of hot weather to go, so let‚Äôs take a look at putting together some cool summer outfits. 





# Color





Perhaps more than anything else, warm weather is an excellent opportunity to enjoy color. While no one‚Äôs stopping you from wearing colorful clothes in the winter, it‚Äôs clear that cold weather tends to be a sad mass of black - mostly for practical reasons. 


But when the sun is shining and there are no coats covering up your outfit, you can bring out the yellows, the pinks, the greens - and they can be the key to taking your attire from just ‚Äúclothes‚Äù to an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 







## color blocking




Color blocking is a tried and true method to add visual interest. Color in an outfit always brings it up a step, but color blocking requires more skill, and more attention paid to silhouette, as well as color pairings. You can opt for colors opposite on the color wheel, or just colors that feel right to you - there are no rules, as long as you love the result. 





[color blocking 1](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QFQSRI1k8D8/YMCzhFYUYmI/AAAAAAAALF0/2gTtzRYlFYYcv3YisM-UKRzFvgWGKBsGwCLcBGAsYHQ/s894/IMG_20210609_121521_902.jpg)

##pop of color




Opting for just a pop of color can be a great way to make your outfit more fun, but without the difficulty of pairing colors together. The easiest way to do it is to add a colorful bag to an otherwise neutral outfit. A lavender bag can give a little contrast to a basic white dress and elevate it to an outfit. Especially if you‚Äôre also pairing it with a colorful pair of shoes. Matching shoes are fine, but an even more interesting choice is a pair of shoes in a complementary color.

## monochrome



Probably a lot of us have worn all-black before, but how many have tried the same in a different color? What is boring and safe in black becomes infinitely more stylish and interesting in a bold color that goes great with a tan. Think about an all pink outfit and what a statement it makes. It‚Äôs still really easy to put together - you‚Äôre only using one color - and yet, it‚Äôs anything but boring.

##tonal dressing



Pairing colors together can be tricky and it‚Äôs often a barrier of entry to fashion for the regular person. But there are easy, somewhat prescriptive ways to do it, like tonal dressing. Not quite monochrome, tonal dressing is more about picking different shades of the same base color or color palette. Adjacent colors, if you will. Both a step above monochrome, and easier than finding identical shades to match, tonal dressing is more visually exciting than a monochromatic outfit, while still being a subtle way to do color.

# Pattern




Perhaps an obvious suggestion, pattern pulls an outfit right out of its boring, solid color nothingness and gives it purpose, it gives it oomph, it gives it visual interest. Where things really get interesting is when you pattern match - or clash. But that‚Äôs a somewhat ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù lesson. For now, even something as simple as choosing a floral skirt instead of a solid colored one can make your clothes an ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù. 




## floral




Yes, yes, florals for spring are not groundbreaking. But we have to walk before we can run. Florals are common, and they‚Äôre easy. A very seasonally-appropriate pattern for spring-summer, it adds a touch of whimsy and femininity to an otherwise simple outfit.

## polka dots & stripes




Polka dots and stripes are other classic patterns you can‚Äôt really go wrong with. They typically still come in neutral colors, for the most part, but you can also find them in more fun colors if you don‚Äôt want to stick to boring black and white.

## abstract




Then, of course, we‚Äôve got the cooler, more modern abstract prints. Paint splotches, random shapes, approximations of faces - anything goes. Why wear a basic white shirt, when you can wear an interesting one?

## gingham




Gingham is a classic summer staple. Casual and light, it‚Äôs a quintessential ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù print. Black and white gingham is a good neutral option, but if you want something more fun, any pastel color + white is very summery while still maintaining visual interest.

## pattern clashing




Of course, the ultimate way to wear pattern is to clash it against more pattern. A higher difficulty task, but with a big visual reward, pattern clashing can make even the most boring, basic outfit look elevated.

# Texture






When you‚Äôve not got many pieces to work with for an outfit, those pieces have to work much harder to be interesting, to stand out, to be ‚Äúworthy‚Äù. In comes texture. An outfit that‚Äôs cotton from top to bottom is not much of an outfit. It‚Äôs plain, flat, and boring. Mixing silk and organza, however, becomes an event. 






## linen/cotton
Linen and cotton are the fabrics of choice for many during the summer. It‚Äôs easy to see why - they keep you cool, they feel nice, and they‚Äôre easy to find on the highstreet at decent prices. Plus, they tend to last - if slightly discolored from the sun. A good basis that you can add to.

## sheer (tulle, gauze, organza)




Sheer is having a huge moment, and now is the time to take full advantage. Despite it being mainly synthetic fabrics, the thinness, sheerness, volume and lightweight quality of these fabrics means they can be easily worn during the height of summer without fear of heatstroke. Beautiful, diaphanous, and eminently *special*, a sheer element can bring the whimsy you need for a wedding outfit, the femininity to a date outfit, or that special je n‚Äôest ce quoi to a simple brunch outfit.

## silk




Silk is in no way as fanciful as it‚Äôs touted to be, and it has the excellent advantage of being a great light-weight option for hot weather. Especially if you need something special or formal, there‚Äôs nothing better than silk. It looks amazing, it‚Äôs cool, and it packs small.

## seersucker



A quintessential summer fabric if there ever was one, seersucker is great for a variety of clothes. Since it‚Äôs so light, it allows you to wear more formal or covered up garments, such as an elegant seersucker suit that would be hot in any other fabric. 




[seersucker 1](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ppkMIfMKA8A/WRu6WZr0T7I/AAAAAAAAXmc/fwbxEejfy1ciW1iw4xBaVr7Xg4lab4XNACEw/s1600/eloquii%2Bseersuker%2Bdress%2B%2Bboater%2Bhat%2Bplus%2Bsize%2Boutfit.jpg)

##muslin




With a slightly ‚Äúcrinkled‚Äù texture, muslin is casual in nature, and it brings visual interest all on its own. Sure, it may not be ideal for a sleek outfit, but it‚Äôs perfect for a billowy sleeveless dress when it‚Äôs too hot to put anything else on, but you still want it to look ~interesting~.

# Proportions & silhouette 





My personal favorite, playing with proportion and silhouette is a subtle and sophisticated way to create An Outfit if you‚Äôre not into accessorizing or it‚Äôs too hot to pile on the necklaces. Structural and sleek, this type of outfit allows shapes to speak for themselves and become the main event, with minimal other distractions. 





## loose on loose



There is no better season to do loose on loose than summer, especially if you prefer not to show skin. As cute as tight dresses are, this is not the time to pull them out. Instead, a pair of cropped wide leg pants can work surprisingly well with a boxy shirt with billowy sleeves. The silhouette is interesting on its own, you don‚Äôt have fabric touching your skin, and you‚Äôre not getting sunburned. All in all, 10/10 summer outfit.

## tight on loose




That isn‚Äôt to say that we can‚Äôt do tight + loose in hot weather, you just have to be more strategic about it. It‚Äôs still a visually interesting silhouette, but in the summer, the tight element should be the top, paired with a looser skirt or pair of pants. A bodycon tanktop or crop top with a pair of high-waisted linen shorts is as elegant as it is cooling.

## structural/architectural detailing 





Sometimes, a single piece with strong architectural detailing can bring all the pizzazz you need. In recent years, with the ushering in of maximalist tendencies, there‚Äôs been no shortage of interesting structural details on summer clothes. A short, but wonderfully voluminous dress is both a statement and a clever way to stay cool. Same with very wide pants, a long column silhouette, intense pleating on a skirt, or an interesting neckline. Unexpected accessories like very chunky shoes paired with a very short dress or a very small purse with a voluminous outfit can also provide that extra kick.

# Interesting details




Seemingly small details can go a long way in elevating a piece, so don‚Äôt discount the power that beading can have, straps, buckles, or even buttons. Some of these details will work better for evening than daytime, but it entire depends on your style, the type of embellishment, and the occasion. Daytime sequins are acceptable outside of Vegas now, I‚Äôm just saying. 






## embellishment




Simple shapes can still look amazing, if you add a little bling. The addition of sequins, rhinestones, or intricate beading can turn a forgettable dress into something special. The best part is that this can be DIY-ed, especially if you have a dress you‚Äôre a little tired of or that is a tad boring. You can be as restrained or as crazy as you want with your embellishments. Pearl straps, bejeweled necklines, or full sequinned pieces - they‚Äôre always a show-stopper.

## straps



With enough sunscreen, or a disregard for unconventional tan lines, something as simple as strap placement can make an outfit more interesting. Very strappy tops are very in right now, as are tops and dresses with open backs with special detailing, like tie-backs, bows, or cut-outs in different shapes.

## buckles, knots, pleating, buttons





Other distinct visual details that can also be utilitarian also help draw the eye, add some contrast, and zuzh up your outfit. Whether it‚Äôs a simple row of contrasting buttons, some statement hardware in the form of a special belt buckle, or gorgeous pleating, these details can say a lot without trying too hard.

# Accessories


Sometimes, the easiest way to do it is just to add accessories. It requires less fussing, and you don‚Äôt have to think as much about them. The biggest bonus here is that accessories rarely make you hotter, but they can still have a huge visual impact and totally ‚Äúmake‚Äù an outfit. 



## textured/colorful/big or small bag




A bag should never be an afterthought, but that‚Äôs especially important to remember when putting together summer outfits. Because you have fewer elements to play with, each of them becomes more important and ‚Äúweighs‚Äù more in the overall structure of your look. 


A very big or very small bag is a tried and true way to bring the unexpected, but you can also achieve a similar effect if you pick a bag that is colorful, or that‚Äôs textured. Consider giving your black leather bags a rest, and instead, enjoying wicker baskets, wooden bags, braided bags, and other unique textures or shapes. Summer is the time for the novelty bag to shine.

## interesting shoes - size, color, heel shape, embellishments




Of course, shoes are also essential. Not just because you literally cannot create an outfit without them, but because they can also weigh heavily in the balance of your outfit. Luckily for us, statement shoes are in, and there‚Äôs plenty to play with in terms of features. Chunky shoes are du jour, but there are also very strappy shoes out there, interesting heel shapes, high platforms, shiny embellishments, and shockingly neon colors.

## hats 



If you‚Äôve ever wished you could wear hats, but were afraid you‚Äôd look like an asshole, now is your time. You have plausible deniability, hats are not just stylish, but they‚Äôre useful, or even necessary, if you live somewhere where the sun is particularly oppressive. Shout out to Australia, the skin cancer capital of the world. 


A straw hat can complete an outfit or push it towards a certain vibe. Chic Gondolier with a breton tee and black shorts? Add a hat. Jungle Adventurer dressed head to toe in new-wave Banana Republic? Add a hat. Baptist Church Lady-core with a ruffly floral dress? Add a hat.

# Third Piece



The third piece is, of course, a basic ‚Äúrule‚Äù for outfit creation, but hot weather makes it just a little bit more difficult, when even one layer of clothing feels like too much to bear. Thankfully, you can ‚Äúcheat‚Äù and still add your third piece, but without adding extra bulk on top of an outfit you‚Äôre already overheating in. 






## linen blazer




For evenings and A/C environments, a linen blazer is very versatile and makes almost any outfit better. It works great with little dresses, shorts, wide leg linen pants - it flatters elegant outfits and beautifully contrasts more casual ones. You really can‚Äôt go wrong, and you also can‚Äôt overheat.

## vests




A more summer-y version of the blazer, the vest is not just very fashionable at the moment, it‚Äôs also the perfect layering piece. Adding minimal bulk, but maximum visual interest, a vest can be paired with anything, from dresses to shirts & shorts, to wearing it by itself as a top. The vest + shorts or vest + pleated pants combo reigns supreme for the spring/summer season; it‚Äôs sophisticated, a little masculine, and a nice departure from typical summer outfits.

## fanny pack/cross body



Any bag can make a good third piece, as we‚Äôve discussed, but a fanny pack worn crossbody is more visible, in many ways, it‚Äôs very cool, and it can be very flattering. Worn on top of a straighter, looser, or more billowy top or dress, it creates some necessary shaping, while still maintaining the casual vibe. Wear it in a contrasting color or interesting texture for maximum effect.

## maximalist jewelry



Jewelry may be the easy way out, but one cannot deny the effect of a truly big-ass pair of earrings with an otherwise simple outfit. Necklaces, rings, and bracelets are not to be ignored, and can also work beautifully to accent an outfit or your great tan, but earrings have the advantage of not touching your skin and they also bring attention to your face, and look great with your hair up - a must, in hot weather.

https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11m7yxr/updating_an_outdated_wardrobe_part_2_office_wear/","how to add visual interest to summer outfits one question that pops up incredibly often on this sub once high temperatures hit is how to make warm weather wear looks interesting the disconnect seems to occur because for fallwinter dressing there is more texture and more layering to play with so it s easier to create an  outfit  rather than just  clothes  when you re only wearing one layer that becomes more difficult and the outfit you re trying to put together can leave something to be desired as it s plain and stripped back 


but you don t have to layer 3 types of clothes in order to maintain style going into the warmer months warm weather has endless opportunities for fashionable dressing and in the glorious absence of a big coat that covers up all your hard work you re free to show off an outfit that plays with colors proportions textures patterns or interesting accessories 


i know summer is technically on its way out but a lot of us still have at least a month or two of hot weather to go so let s take a look at putting together some cool summer outfits 





 color





perhaps more than anything else warm weather is an excellent opportunity to enjoy color while no one s stopping you from wearing colorful clothes in the winter it s clear that cold weather tends to be a sad mass of black  mostly for practical reasons 


but when the sun is shining and there are no coats covering up your outfit you can bring out the yellows the pinks the greens  and they can be the key to taking your attire from just  clothes  to an  outfit  







 color blocking




color blocking is a tried and true method to add visual interest color in an outfit always brings it up a step but color blocking requires more skill and more attention paid to silhouette as well as color pairings you can opt for colors opposite on the color wheel or just colors that feel right to you  there are no rules as long as you love the result

pop of color




opting for just a pop of color can be a great way to make your outfit more fun but without the difficulty of pairing colors together the easiest way to do it is to add a colorful bag to an otherwise neutral outfit a lavender bag can give a little contrast to a basic white dress and elevate it to an outfit especially if you re also pairing it with a colorful pair of shoes matching shoes are fine but an even more interesting choice is a pair of shoes in a complementary color

 monochrome



probably a lot of us have worn allblack before but how many have tried the same in a different color what is boring and safe in black becomes infinitely more stylish and interesting in a bold color that goes great with a tan think about an all pink outfit and what a statement it makes it s still really easy to put together  you re only using one color  and yet it s anything but boring 






monochrome 1


monochrome 2


monochrome 3





tonal dressing



pairing colors together can be tricky and it s often a barrier of entry to fashion for the regular person but there are easy somewhat prescriptive ways to do it like tonal dressing not quite monochrome tonal dressing is more about picking different shades of the same base color or color palette adjacent colors if you will both a step above monochrome and easier than finding identical shades to match tonal dressing is more visually exciting than a monochromatic outfit while still being a subtle way to do color  






tonal 1


tonal 2

 pattern




perhaps an obvious suggestion pattern pulls an outfit right out of its boring solid color nothingness and gives it purpose it gives it oomph it gives it visual interest where things really get interesting is when you pattern match  or clash but that s a somewhat  advanced  lesson for now even something as simple as choosing a floral skirt instead of a solid colored one can make your clothes an  outfit  




 floral




yes yes florals for spring are not groundbreaking but we have to walk before we can run florals are common and they re easy a very seasonallyappropriate pattern for springsummer it adds a touch of whimsy and femininity to an otherwise simple outfit 




floral 1

 polka dots  stripes




polka dots and stripes are other classic patterns you can t really go wrong with they typically still come in neutral colors for the most part but you can also find them in more fun colors if you don t want to stick to boring black and white

 abstract




then of course we ve got the cooler more modern abstract prints paint splotches random shapes approximations of faces  anything goes why wear a basic white shirt when you can wear an interesting one

 gingham




gingham is a classic summer staple casual and light it s a quintessential  picnic  print black and white gingham is a good neutral option but if you want something more fun any pastel color  white is very summery while still maintaining visual interest 






gingham 1


gingham 2


gingham 3

 pattern clashing




of course the ultimate way to wear pattern is to clash it against more pattern a higher difficulty task but with a big visual reward pattern clashing can make even the most boring basic outfit look elevated

 texture






when you ve not got many pieces to work with for an outfit those pieces have to work much harder to be interesting to stand out to be  worthy  in comes texture an outfit that s cotton from top to bottom is not much of an outfit it s plain flat and boring mixing silk and organza however becomes an event 






 linencotton
linen and cotton are the fabrics of choice for many during the summer it s easy to see why  they keep you cool they feel nice and they re easy to find on the highstreet at decent prices plus they tend to last  if slightly discolored from the sun a good basis that you can add to 




linen cotton 1


linen cotton 2


linen cotton 3




 sheer tulle gauze organza




sheer is having a huge moment and now is the time to take full advantage despite it being mainly synthetic fabrics the thinness sheerness volume and lightweight quality of these fabrics means they can be easily worn during the height of summer without fear of heatstroke beautiful diaphanous and eminently special a sheer element can bring the whimsy you need for a wedding outfit the femininity to a date outfit or that special je n est ce quoi to a simple brunch outfit

 silk




silk is in no way as fanciful as it s touted to be and it has the excellent advantage of being a great lightweight option for hot weather especially if you need something special or formal there s nothing better than silk it looks amazing it s cool and it packs small 





silk 1

 seersucker



a quintessential summer fabric if there ever was one seersucker is great for a variety of clothes since it s so light it allows you to wear more formal or covered up garments such as an elegant seersucker suit that would be hot in any other fabric 




seersucker 1


seersucker 2




muslin




with a slightly  crinkled  texture muslin is casual in nature and it brings visual interest all on its own sure it may not be ideal for a sleek outfit but it s perfect for a billowy sleeveless dress when it s too hot to put anything else on but you still want it to look interesting 




muslin 1


muslin 2


muslin 3






 proportions  silhouette 





my personal favorite playing with proportion and silhouette is a subtle and sophisticated way to create an outfit if you re not into accessorizing or it s too hot to pile on the necklaces structural and sleek this type of outfit allows shapes to speak for themselves and become the main event with minimal other distractions 





 loose on loose



there is no better season to do loose on loose than summer especially if you prefer not to show skin as cute as tight dresses are this is not the time to pull them out instead a pair of cropped wide leg pants can work surprisingly well with a boxy shirt with billowy sleeves the silhouette is interesting on its own you don t have fabric touching your skin and you re not getting sunburned all in all 1010 summer outfit 




loose 1


loose 2


loose 3


loose 4


loose 5




 tight on loose




that isn t to say that we can t do tight  loose in hot weather you just have to be more strategic about it it s still a visually interesting silhouette but in the summer the tight element should be the top paired with a looser skirt or pair of pants a bodycon tanktop or crop top with a pair of highwaisted linen shorts is as elegant as it is cooling




tight 1

 structuralarchitectural detailing 





sometimes a single piece with strong architectural detailing can bring all the pizzazz you need in recent years with the ushering in of maximalist tendencies there s been no shortage of interesting structural details on summer clothes a short but wonderfully voluminous dress is both a statement and a clever way to stay cool same with very wide pants a long column silhouette intense pleating on a skirt or an interesting neckline unexpected accessories like very chunky shoes paired with a very short dress or a very small purse with a voluminous outfit can also provide that extra kick 






structural 1


structural 2

 interesting details




seemingly small details can go a long way in elevating a piece so don t discount the power that beading can have straps buckles or even buttons some of these details will work better for evening than daytime but it entire depends on your style the type of embellishment and the occasion daytime sequins are acceptable outside of vegas now i m just saying 






 embellishment




simple shapes can still look amazing if you add a little bling the addition of sequins rhinestones or intricate beading can turn a forgettable dress into something special the best part is that this can be diyed especially if you have a dress you re a little tired of or that is a tad boring you can be as restrained or as crazy as you want with your embellishments pearl straps bejeweled necklines or full sequinned pieces  they re always a showstopper 




embellishment 1


embellishment 2

 straps



with enough sunscreen or a disregard for unconventional tan lines something as simple as strap placement can make an outfit more interesting very strappy tops are very in right now as are tops and dresses with open backs with special detailing like tiebacks bows or cutouts in different shapes 




straps 1



straps 2


straps 3




 buckles knots pleating buttons





other distinct visual details that can also be utilitarian also help draw the eye add some contrast and zuzh up your outfit whether it s a simple row of contrasting buttons some statement hardware in the form of a special belt buckle or gorgeous pleating these details can say a lot without trying too hard 



details 1

 accessories


sometimes the easiest way to do it is just to add accessories it requires less fussing and you don t have to think as much about them the biggest bonus here is that accessories rarely make you hotter but they can still have a huge visual impact and totally  make  an outfit 



 texturedcolorfulbig or small bag




a bag should never be an afterthought but that s especially important to remember when putting together summer outfits because you have fewer elements to play with each of them becomes more important and  weighs  more in the overall structure of your look 


a very big or very small bag is a tried and true way to bring the unexpected but you can also achieve a similar effect if you pick a bag that is colorful or that s textured consider giving your black leather bags a rest and instead enjoying wicker baskets wooden bags braided bags and other unique textures or shapes summer is the time for the novelty bag to shine

 interesting shoes  size color heel shape embellishments




of course shoes are also essential not just because you literally cannot create an outfit without them but because they can also weigh heavily in the balance of your outfit luckily for us statement shoes are in and there s plenty to play with in terms of features chunky shoes are du jour but there are also very strappy shoes out there interesting heel shapes high platforms shiny embellishments and shockingly neon colors

a straw hat can complete an outfit or push it towards a certain vibe chic gondolier with a breton tee and black shorts add a hat jungle adventurer dressed head to toe in newwave banana republic add a hat baptist church ladycore with a ruffly floral dress add a hat

 third piece



the third piece is of course a basic  rule  for outfit creation but hot weather makes it just a little bit more difficult when even one layer of clothing feels like too much to bear thankfully you can  cheat  and still add your third piece but without adding extra bulk on top of an outfit you re already overheating in 






 linen blazer




for evenings and ac environments a linen blazer is very versatile and makes almost any outfit better it works great with little dresses shorts wide leg linen pants  it flatters elegant outfits and beautifully contrasts more casual ones you really can t go wrong and you also can t overheat

second edit thanks to all for a very engaging and civil discussion i had hoped to spark discussion around one of the lessdiscussed sides of fashion and i feel we succeeded thanks ffa",Positive
femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,"""The average American bought buys 68 new articles of clothing per year"" I'm European and that statement sounds just crazy/impossible. What did you guys buy this year?","I can't be sure for other Europan countries, but where I'm from, people definitely don't buy nearly that many clothes. If anyone cares, this year I have bought (and please mind, this year  was probably 3 times what I usually buy):

-1 Dr Martens, 1 ankle boots, 1 over the knee boots

-1 knitted dress, 1 cardigan, 1 dress shirt

-I found out theres a 2nd hand shop in my city, so I bought: 1 leather jacket, 2 button down shirts, 2 blouses

-1 pair of jeans

-1 coctail dress, 1 business dress, 1 blazer

-wedding dress, wedding shoes

-every-day-underwear

(just for fun info: 817 cca total)

That's 17 items, and with all panties and bras it would probably come to 30 items. And this was my shopping spree year, since pretty much everything in my wardrobe was at least 5 years old and getting worn out. In 2020 I'm planning to buy only 1-2 Gracosy shoes.

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,Now I see how ASOS can afford to price things so cheaply :/,"I've been a lurker for a while but finally decided to post after reading this article on working conditions in the UK ASOS distribution warehouses:

https://www.buzzfeed.com/saraspary/these-asos-workers-are-paying-the-true-price-of-your-order?utm_term=.vtWRaXW1V#.afDxJGjpl

When I first discovered ASOS a few years ago it was a godsend; it seemed to be much better quality than other fast fashion outlets, had items in tall sizes, with many quality fibers, and fast and free shipping both ways. I had briefly searched for info on how ethically its items were produced and found that most of it was manufactured in factories with strict oversight. So that made me feel more comfortable buying from them than places like F21.

However, I feel really disappointed after reading this buzzfeed expos√© on the working conditions of its distribution warehouse employees. I guess deep down I knew there had to be some ""catch"" to its production and distribution pipeline, like there is for most clothing companies. After doing some more research it seems these complaints have been around for a while, but I was never aware of them.

Anyway, I'd be interested to know what you all think about this. The pressure workers face and their anxiety about taking basic breaks to go to the bathroom and get water makes me feel like I shouldn't buy from them again until I hear that the warehouse management has fixed these issues. 

Also, I'm curious to know if other companies ever been able to fix similar issues without changing the pricing or quality on their products.

Finally, does anyone have any suggestions for a company with similar items to ASOS clothing that is more ethically produced and at a similar price point?",1475684690.0,"Now I see how ASOS can afford to price things so cheaply :/ I've been a lurker for a while but finally decided to post after reading this article on working conditions in the UK ASOS distribution warehouses:

femalefashionadvice,ethical clothing,Small Wardrobe vs Big Wardrobe,"Yesterday morning I was feeling like I was in a bit of a rut fashion wise. I like to keep my wardrobe small, and operate with seasonal capsules. But, I haven‚Äôt done much in the way of shopping for new additions to my summer capsule (shorts, light weight cardigans) to add in for the season. So I felt very blah. 


My sister on the other hand, is the TJMaxx queen. While my total clothing tally is probably 60 pieces or less, with 30 in a capsule at a time, she probably has well over 300 individual pieces of clothing. We live together, so sometimes when I‚Äôm in a rut, I‚Äôll borrow her stuff and it‚Äôll be like a breath of fresh air. She buys anything on sale at TJMaxx, even if she doesn‚Äôt *love* it, hunts through Plato‚Äôs Closet for cute shorts, and always finds the best quality stuff at thrift stores. I‚Äôd call her a hoarder if it wasn‚Äôt so convenient. Her reasoning? ‚ÄúIf you or [other sister], or one of my friends needs something specific to wear, it‚Äôs pretty likely I‚Äôll have it and they can borrow it instead of having to buy a new one‚Äù. 


While I LOVE my tiny wardrobe for getting dressed on a daily basis, and the ease of being able to throw something on without thinking about it, and knowing it will match. Sometimes there are days where I‚Äôm bloated and want a pair of comfy-but-put-together joggers, and I haven‚Äôt bought one because I haven‚Äôt found ‚Äúthe perfect pair‚Äù. The ones that will last 8 seasons, and are made of natural fabrics, and from an ethical brand. She has 4 pairs that she got in different colors during a Forever 21 sale, and I‚Äôm welcome to borrow whichever I like. 


Obviously everyone has different preferences when it comes to wardrobe, but as someone who has a small wardrobe, I‚Äôve also grown to appreciate the merits of having a large wardrobe like my sister. (Or at least borrowing stuff from her small department store of a closet). 


Do you have a big wardrobe or a small wardrobe? Do you ever have a ‚Äúgrass is greener‚Äù feeling when you‚Äôre having trouble picking an outfit in the morning? Do you think you‚Äôll downsize/size up your wardrobe any time soon because of that feeling? 


Edited to say my sister buys stuff she doesn‚Äôt totally *love* not stuff she doesn‚Äôt like just because it‚Äôs cheap.

frugalmalefashion,everlane,[Review] I spent $700 to find the best jeans for guys with BIG thighs!,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wobnriw52vg81.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ee970b62f9392e5365e30a7b4e3e31e0380bda2

So what are the best jeans for guys with MASSIVE legs??  This question gets asked so much around here, it‚Äôs basically a meme.

If you‚Äôre like me though and you have big legs, you probably hate shopping for jeans online. It‚Äôs such a pain in the ass that I avoid it as much as possible. Lately though I‚Äôve been needing a  new pair of jeans since my old ones are worn out and don‚Äôt fit me anymore. So I decided to try on a bunch of the recommended options here to find the best jeans for me.

10 jeans and $700 dollars later, I was able to find a few pairs that I actually really  loved. The experience was still annoying though but I was super happy with the few jeans I kept and hopefully I won't have to do this again for a while. Here‚Äôs my honest review of each jean I tried and what I liked and didn‚Äôt like about it.

For you visual guys out there, I also made a [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt8mm2hzw-M) that has all the info from below, plus links plus you can see how they fit on me.

For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 190lbs. I wear a 34x32 jean size and my thighs are 27in wide.

# #1 Wrangler‚Äôs Regular Taper Jean

* $26.99, made of 98% cotton and 2% spandex.
* I think these are the best jeans all around. Only $30 but fit really well and are comfortable. There‚Äôs plenty of room in the seat area and they‚Äôre tapered at the bottom so it looks clean. I own 3 other pairs of these and I use them for working around the house and casually around town. If I could buy just one pair of jeans these would be it.

# #2 Amazon Essentials Athletic Stretch Jean

* $31.90, made of 98% cotton and 2% elastane
* These are way too big and baggy. They are big in the waist and also super long in the bottom. Definitely size down if you‚Äôre thinking about buying these. Also I didn‚Äôt love the material, it‚Äôs not very soft and they have a course and rough feeling to them.

# #3 Everlane Athletic Stretch Jean

* $88, made of 94% cotton, 2% elastane and 4% other materials
* By far my favorite jeans in this Haul. These are extremely comfortable and the material feels heavy, like it‚Äôs a super high quality. They are is super soft and stretchy. They feel comfortable when sitting down so I can wear this when I work at my desk. The taper on the bottom is perfect too. They are a little large in the waist, so I probably could have sized down to 33x32 with these but they didn‚Äôt have this size

# #4 JCrew 1040 Athletic jean

* $98, made of 100% cotton even though the website says they should have some stretch material to them.
* I had high hopes for these, but I was super disappointed. There‚Äôs barely any stretch to them and they don‚Äôt feel comfortable at all. They restrict my movement when walking or even just standing up straight. When I bend down in these, it feels like they‚Äôre going to rip any moment. Also at $100 they‚Äôre a little overpriced. Do not recommend these for guys with big legs.

# #5 Abercrombie & Fitch Athletic Skinny Jeans

* $78, made of 94% cotton, 4% polyester and 2% elastane.
* These jeans are amazing. They fit really well, and they are soft and stretchy and feel really comfortable. Also they are very fashion forward, more so than any other brand I tried. So these would be perfect for date nights. Definitely in top 3 of this Haul.

# #6 Levis 541‚Ñ¢ Athletic Taper Fit

* $79.50, made of 68% cotton, 31% lyocell and 1% elastane.
* Overpriced. The fit is good but the material feels kind of cheap, they are light weight and there‚Äôs too much stretch, at least for my taste. I know these are classics and everyone recommends them, but for the same price, I recommend the Everlane or the Abercrombie instead.

# #7 American Eagle Athletic Fit Jean

* $39.95, made of 99% cotton and 1% elastane
* Blown away how good these jeans were, and only $40. They're extremely soft and super comfortable. This pair is 33x32 and they fit perfect. They sit just right in the waist area and there‚Äôs plenty of room in the seat and leg. I only wish they had more colors on their website. When I checked they only had 3 and I liked the light wash the best.

# #8 Gap Flex Athletic Taper Jeans

* $70, made of 93% cotton, 5% elastane and 2% spandex
* I loved, loved the color but these jeans are way too short. The inseam feels more like a 30‚Äô instead of 32‚Äô. They fit okay in the waist, but are too short on the bottom. When I cuff them up they look like capri pants. Gap is cool though, they have tons of discounts all the time and I‚Äôve never paid full price for anything from them.

# #9 Lucky Brand 411 Athletic Taper

* $69.30, made of 94% cotton 4% polyester 2% elastane
* Really soft and comfortable. They fit true to size but the taper on the legs is a little too aggressive. They are also a little too stretchy for my taste. I was on the fence with these and almost kept them. I liked them, but I didn‚Äôt really love them. I don‚Äôt know why but I ended up returning them. Maybe they were just too basic and for $70 I didn‚Äôt think they were worth it.

# #10 Lee Men's Legendary Athletic Tapered Leg Jean

* $32.79, made of 99% cotton and 1% spandex.
* Along with Wranger‚Äôs and Amazon Essentials these were the other budget jeans I tried. They were only $32 but they are way too long in the bottom and not tapered at all. They have more of a bootcut leg opening. The fabric feels really soft though, better than the Wranglers or the Amazon Essentials. They stretch and are comfortable when sitting down. For $32 I‚Äôd definitely get these if they were to fit me a little better.

# Summing up

And that was it. I tried 10 pairs and ended up keeping 4. I‚Äôm super happy with the jeans I found and I didn‚Äôt just settle for the first available brand out there.

If there‚Äôs one thing I learned from this haul is this though: **make sure the jeans you buy have some type of stretch material in them**. 100% cotton will be too restrictive and won't feel comfortable.

As far as best jeans, here‚Äôs my favorite:

**Best overall** \--- Wranglers

**Most comfortable** \--- Everlane

**Most Fashionable** \--- Abercrombie

**Biggest Surprise** \--- American Eagle",1644435777.0,"[Review] I spent $700 to find the best jeans for guys with BIG thighs! &#x200B;

frugalmalefashion,everlane,[Review] Best high-end Joggers For Men,"&#x200B;

Hey guys I‚Äôm back with my second post on the topic of joggers. For this post I try on and review 10 high-end joggers. What‚Äôs high-end? Well joggers that are around $100 dollars or more.

Last week I made a post on 10 budget joggers, those are around $40 or less. So if you don‚Äôt want to spend your entire paycheck on one of these pairs, [check out that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/menshauls/comments/t28d8f/review_best_joggers_under_40/). There are some really great and affordable options there.

For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 190 pounds. My pants size is 33x32 and all joggers in this haul are size Large.

# [Video](https://youtu.be/MA8n-nFflJ8)

As always, here's a [video](https://youtu.be/MA8n-nFflJ8) that goes along with this review. But I don't post this to shill my YT channel. Instead I want people to see that I personally try on all joggers and that this review is genuine and  not just a random list of joggers I've found online. Also if people want to see what these joggers look like on someone my size they can watch the video too. I personally prefer videos over images when buying stuff and I think others will like it too.

Enough talking, here's the details for each pair:

# [Best Overall] Lululemon City Sweat Joggers - $118

* Made from 52% polyester, 42% cotton and 6% lycra
* Can‚Äôt get any better than these. Seriously, to me, these are everything that I‚Äôm looking for in a pair of joggers. They are super soft and comfortable, they fit really well, they have some structure to them so they are versatile, I can wear them at home, at the gym, when traveling. I just love these. They fit slime to the leg but not too tight so you get that nice clean and tapered look. Also the fabric on these is the perfect blend between cotton and polyester, it's natural but also feels strong and durable. If you like these but don‚Äôt want to spend $120, check the Uniqlos from my other post. they are very similar. I reviewed those in my other video but those are equivalent sweatpants on a budget.

# Reigning Champ Slim Sweatpant - $120

* Mae from 100% cotton
* Right off the bat these feel very similar to the Goodthreads ones I reviewed in my budget joggers post. These are $120 and those are only $27. Now these are made in Canada and you can tell the craftsmanship and attention to detail is superior, especially the stitching. They are heavyweight and you can just tell they are high quality. The fit on these is a bit slimmer than most joggers, they make my legs skinnier. These are good sweatpants and high quality, but personally if I‚Äôm being totally honest,  I‚Äôd pick the $27 Goodthreads over these. I think they are too similar, and for $100 difference I don‚Äôt think it justifies the price. But if you want something that's high quality, that will last a long time and you have the money to spend, then the Reigning Champ are a good option.

# Vuori Sunday performance - $89

* Made from 88% polyester and 12% elastane
* These are very stretchy. They are definitely performance joggers that are made for running and being active in general. Personally I don‚Äôt like the synthetic feel of polyester, so these are not for me. Also they don‚Äôt have very much structure to them, so I wouldn‚Äôt wear them outside the house very much, maybe only to the gym. Also they hug my calves a little too tight, there‚Äôs too much taper there and I can feel them around my calves. Personally I prefer joggers that are more versatile, so these don‚Äôt really fit my lifestyle and I‚Äôll return them.

# Western Rise Spectrum Jogger - $128

* Made from 100% polyester
* First thing, these guys charge for shipping and I feel like if I‚Äôm spending $128 for a pair of joggers, shipping better be free. All other brands offer free shipping. So right off the bat, the customer experience  put a bad taste in my mouth. As far as the joggers go, the material feels techy but they don‚Äôt really fit me. They are way too long in the bottom and they are kind of baggy in general. Also they ride up my thighs weirdly. The whole crotch area just seems off for some reason. I didn‚Äôt really love these joggers, and for $128 for 100% polyester I think these are overpriced so I returned them.

# [Best Structured] Lululemon ABC jogger - $128

* Made from their warpstreme fabric, which is 53% elastomultiester and 47% polyester.
* Just like the Lululemon City Sweat, these are extremely well made joggers. The way they feel and the way they look, you can tell it‚Äôs a premier sweatpant. The price of $128 is steep, but I think it‚Äôs totally justified. Out of the entire haul, I think Lululemons were the only joggers where I think the price was justified, they feel like the best quality by far. Now these joggers feel a lot more technical than the City Sweat joggers, there is more of that synthetic feel to them. But I still like how they feel when I put them on. As far as the fit, these are just slightly too long in the bottom, and also the waist is not very stretch so when I put them on I have to work a little harder. But it‚Äôs not a big deal, once I have them on I think they look great and they are comfortable. They have a very structured look to them. These are definitely more dressed up and formal joggers and can be worn, at home, outside, to the gym. You can probably pull these off even in the office, but only If you‚Äôre a software engineer or designer, one of the creative types. I was on the fence, I really really liked these and I was going to keep them until I tried the Olivers below. But I think these are amazing joggers and I definitely would recommend them.

# Everlane Renew Air Pant

* $68 and made of 86% polyester and 14% elastane
* These feel and look very similar to the Vuoris, except that they are $20 cheaper. These are a little more loose and a little more baggy than the Vuoris, but other than that it feels like the exact same jogger. These are very unstructured, but I prefer more structure on the joggers, I like them to look and feel more sharp instead of so casual and relaxed. Also I don‚Äôt love polyester and I prefer cotton blends or something more breathable.  But the polyester has its benefits,  they‚Äôll last forever, they don‚Äôt wrinkle, they won‚Äôt shrink and  they are good for running or exercising. But I don‚Äôt run and when I do, I prefer to do it in shorts. So I think these are okay, but not for me. I‚Äôll return them

# Mac Weldon Ace Sweatpant - $78

* Made from 95% cotton and 5% spandex
* These are my second most favorite pair of joggers in this Haul. These are really really nice. They are super comfortable, they fit close to the leg but they are stretchy and breathable. Also they are silm and tapered and they look very sharp when I have these on.  I don‚Äôt know how they hold up, but at first impression they feel like premium quality. And at $78 they are the most reasonably priced joggers in this Haul. They use micro-brushed french terry, which I have no idea what it is, but it‚Äôs really soft so I like it. At the bottom they‚Äôre not really cuffed, it‚Äôs more like a taper but it‚Äôs okay for me, I don‚Äôt have a preference either way. They do have a random side pocket which I have no idea what I would ever use it for, it‚Äôs too small for a phone and just kind of sits there awkwardly. My only issue with these is how they fit in the thighs. I have big thighs so these are too tight in that area, and when I wash them and they shrink I know that they will not fit me very well. So I‚Äôm bummed out and I wish I could keep these, but because of how they fit my legs I would return them. But if you have smaller thighs I would recommend these $100, they are awesome!

# [Best Structured] Olivers Bradburry Jogger - $118

* Made from 88% Nylon and 12% elastane
* Don‚Äôt know what it was about these joggers, but as soon as I put them on I knew I‚Äôd be keeping them. The fit on them is perfect and also the material great too. Just this weekend we went out to a brewery and I wore these and I already got tons of compliments. They are 88/% Nylon so they are still synthetic but they still feel really good, very breathable and they don‚Äôt get in the way. These and Lulu ABCs are the only two structured joggers I liked. They are very similar, but ultimately I decided on these because the Lulus are more heavyweight material and with spring and summer the Olivers are way more practical. Also the fit on these is better. So while they are $118, I feel guilty even saying it,  they are 100% worth it in my mind. I ended up keeping these and I‚Äôm super happy with them.

# Public Rec All Day Everyday Jogger - $108

* Made of 88% nylon and 12% spandex.
* These joggers feel really soft. But I don‚Äôt like how they fit. They are way too tight all around, too tight in the waist, too long in the bottom. Also to me, they look and feel very similar to the Mac Weldons, but the Mac Weldons use cotton and they fit better and they are also $30 cheaper. So I ended up returning these because they didn‚Äôt fit me, and for the same price the Mac Weldons are a far better deal.

# Outdoor Voices All Day Sweatpant - $88

* Made of 94% Polyester, 6% Spandex
* So these never came in the mail, they were stuck somewhere in Sacramento, CA. But even if they did, I‚Äôm pretty sure I would not have kept them. After trying on so many joggers I know that I don‚Äôt like the polyester fabric on these and they would not have been for me. These are in the same class as the Vuoris and the Everlanes, and while they have their use, they don‚Äôt fit my lifestyle so I will probably have returned them.

Well that was it. Ultimately, out of 20 joggers I tried, I decided to keep 4 pairs. It wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, there were some great joggers in here, they‚Äôre affordable and they‚Äôre comfortable. But here‚Äôs the ones I picked for myself:

1. Lululemon City Sweat Jogger
2. The Olivers Bradburry
3. The Zara Knit Sweatpant \[Budget Joggers Haul\]
4. and the Hanes EcoSmart \[Budget Joggers Haul\]

# Recommendations

After doing this for 20 joggers, here‚Äôs the ones I would recommend:

**Best Overall**

* Lululemon City Sweat Jogger. Mac Weldons also come close second

**Best Overall on Budget**

* Uniqlo Sweatpant which are $30.

**Best Structured**

* Olivers Bradburry Jogger. The Lululemon ABC jogger comes at close second and it's better if you want more heavy weight materal.

**Best Structured on Budget**

* Zara or the H&M from my budget joggers haul. Zara ones are $40 and H&M are $25.

**Best Lounging Sweatpant**

* None from the high end haul. For lounging sweatpants, I would go with one of the bugdet ones below, they are better value imo.

**Best Lounging Sweatpant on a Budget**

* Gap Vintage Soft Jogger for lightweight. For mid to heavier weight, then check out the Goodthreads Fleece Joggers.

That‚Äôs it, I hope to not have to do another jogger try on for a very very long time after this. Thank you guys for reading this far down and until next time!",1647018797.0,"[Review] Best high-end Joggers For Men &#x200B;

Hey guys I‚Äôm back with my second post on the topic of joggers. For this post I try on and review 10 high-end joggers. What‚Äôs high-end? Well joggers that are around $100 dollars or more.

Last week I made a post on 10 budget joggers, those are around $40 or less. So if you don‚Äôt want to spend your entire paycheck on one of these pairs, [check out that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/menshauls/comments/t28d8f/review_best_joggers_under_40/). There are some really great and affordable options there.

For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 190 pounds. My pants size is 33x32 and all joggers in this haul are size Large.

# [Video](https://youtu.be/MA8n-nFflJ8)

As always, here's a [video](https://youtu.be/MA8n-nFflJ8) that goes along with this review. But I don't post this to shill my YT channel. Instead I want people to see that I personally try on all joggers and that this review is genuine and  not just a random list of joggers I've found online. Also if people want to see what these joggers look like on someone my size they can watch the video too. I personally prefer videos over images when buying stuff and I think others will like it too.

Enough talking, here's the details for each pair:

# [Best Overall] Lululemon City Sweat Joggers - $118

* Made from 52% polyester, 42% cotton and 6% lycra
* Can‚Äôt get any better than these. Seriously, to me, these are everything that I‚Äôm looking for in a pair of joggers. They are super soft and comfortable, they fit really well, they have some structure to them so they are versatile, I can wear them at home, at the gym, when traveling. I just love these. They fit slime to the leg but not too tight so you get that nice clean and tapered look. Also the fabric on these is the perfect blend between cotton and polyester, it's natural but also feels strong and durable. If you like these but don‚Äôt want to spend $120, check the Uniqlos from my other post. they are very similar. I reviewed those in my other video but those are equivalent sweatpants on a budget.

# Reigning Champ Slim Sweatpant - $120

* Mae from 100% cotton
* Right off the bat these feel very similar to the Goodthreads ones I reviewed in my budget joggers post. These are $120 and those are only $27. Now these are made in Canada and you can tell the craftsmanship and attention to detail is superior, especially the stitching. They are heavyweight and you can just tell they are high quality. The fit on these is a bit slimmer than most joggers, they make my legs skinnier. These are good sweatpants and high quality, but personally if I‚Äôm being totally honest,  I‚Äôd pick the $27 Goodthreads over these. I think they are too similar, and for $100 difference I don‚Äôt think it justifies the price. But if you want something that's high quality, that will last a long time and you have the money to spend, then the Reigning Champ are a good option.

# Vuori Sunday performance - $89

* Made from 88% polyester and 12% elastane
* These are very stretchy. They are definitely performance joggers that are made for running and being active in general. Personally I don‚Äôt like the synthetic feel of polyester, so these are not for me. Also they don‚Äôt have very much structure to them, so I wouldn‚Äôt wear them outside the house very much, maybe only to the gym. Also they hug my calves a little too tight, there‚Äôs too much taper there and I can feel them around my calves. Personally I prefer joggers that are more versatile, so these don‚Äôt really fit my lifestyle and I‚Äôll return them.

# Western Rise Spectrum Jogger - $128

frugalmalefashion,allbirds,Allbirds Mizzle Review,"I bought a pair of Allbirds Mizzles a few weeks ago. Here's my short review:

Overall
2.5 / 5
Wouldn't recommend these. For a pair of shoes for 130$ I'd expect more comfort and support. Maybe the regular wool runners might fit me better?

The Good:

1. They look really good. They're a great looking pair of sneakers, especially for me I like understated looks and this totally hit the spot.

2. The laces are really high quality. Tying my shoelaces is effortless.

3. The shoes are light and the soles are soft.

The bad:

1. The soles are too soft, which makes it okay for standing around or basically very short walks. I couldn't get used to walking in these. I generally walk about 2 - 3 miles a day and these weren't helping at all.

2. The mizzles are meant to be waterproof so the soles are thicker, which takes a little bit to get used to.

3. They're not for warmer climates. Since they don't breathe that well. My feet definitely felt warm while I was traveling with these to a warmer place.

Other notes:

Would recommend you try these in-store and size up. 

For comparison, I was wearing New Balance Fresh Foam before this and I was overall happier with that (no water resistance though)

frugalmalefashion,ethical clothing,Deals and Frugality,"**TL;DR:**

1.	This sub probably should have been called malefashiondeals or something similar, but it isn't.
2.	An item or post is ""not frugal"" just because you wouldn't buy it or spend that amount of money.
3.	If you wouldn't buy an item or think it/the price is stupid, **DON'T POST IN THE THREAD.**

# Overview

It seems more than ever, that this sub has been overrun by comments and debates over frugality, putting an entirely unnecessary workload on the mods, as well as derailing [very useful threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/k0a6aj/i_spent_600_on_tshirts_to_find_the_best_one/). In light of this, I wanted to make a post discussing frugality and how it specifically applies to this sub. In this sub, frugality can be thought of as trying to achieve the best price on an item you want.

However, the theories of [depreciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation) and [amortization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization) are much more important to the spirit of FMF.

You can think of every piece of clothing, pair of shoes, or other fashion item as a depreciating asset. The cost you paid for it is spread out over every single time you get a use out of that item. This is why places like /r/BIFL or /r/GoodyearWelt are so popular - people naturally want to buy items that bring them a high level of satisfaction, while also having the longest possible useful life.

# Useful Life

**Timberland Boots - $90**

|Useful Life?|120 wears (2 seasons)|
|:-|:-|
|Recraftable?|No|

**GYW Boots - $250**

|Useful Life?|240 wears (4 seasons)|
|:-|:-|
|Recraftable?|Yes. Cost $100.|
|Additional Life?|240 wears|

The Timberlands work out to 75 cents per wear, after which, you would need to replace with a new pair.

For the GYW boots, this works out to 73 cents per wear. So cost of ownership here, the $250 GYW are actually cheaper than Timberland boots! And if they are well taken care of, it is possible that they can be resoled and restore again, bringing the cost per wear even lower.

I don't want to get into debates over how long Timberlands vs. certain GYW boots would last, as this will differ with every item and how people take care of them, but this principle applies to **everything posted in this sub!** From t-shirts, to flannels, to outerwear - useful life is the key.

# Functionality

**Patagonia vs. Columbia**

Patagonia is arguably one of the top outdoor brands in the world. They utilize top of the line technical fabrics and insulation, have spotless quality control, and offer an unbeatable warranty. Because of this, you can expect to [pay a premium](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-nano-puff-jacket/84212.html) when it comes to their clothing. But, due to the quality and warranty, you can expect a very long useful life as discussed above.

Columbia used to be great, but after acquisition from an outside company and poor quality control, they've dropped off. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/a0qb88/what_are_your_thoughts_on_columbias_quality_and/) is a good thread on that.

In addition to useful life, **functionality** is important. Patagonia's gore-tex shells or insulated jackets will undoubtedly beat out Columbia or cheaper outdoor clothing companies. This means that you stay warmer, dryer, and happier while using the item you purchased. To most people, that is worth a considerable amount of extra money. It's up to the person to evaluate how much more they would spend for functionality.

# Others

I'm not going to go in depth on these here, but things like ethical purchasing, supporting small business/artisans, specific styling and fashion, and more can all be considerations for people when purchasing items. These all play into how much money people are willing to spend.

# Result

**So what?** Maybe you've read this far and think ""Who cares? I love my $4 t-shirts and Walmart jeans and my mom says I look cute!"" Great! You've found frugal items that work for you and your budget.

**But people come to this sub to find great deals on items they want.**

That might be a $50 t-shirt you can't imagine buying. But if that t-shirt lasts 300 more wears, has better stitching, is made from higher quality cotton, and fits better - that might justify the price for most people. And if somebody finds a coupon for 30% off and posts it to FMF? Now that $50 t-shirt is only $35.

What I really want to discourage is the absolute disbelief that people might buy $50 t-shirts, $200 jackets, or $500 boots. People buy far more expensive items than this. I guarantee that most people who come into this sub have a hobby that they spend more money than normal on, given they have the means. Walk up to a random person on the street and tell them that you spent $500 on a RTX 3070 and they would probably ask ""...why?"" **USEFUL LIFE AND FUNCTIONALITY!!!**

If somebody has been coveting the perfect boots for years, and finally, somebody posts a sale on FMF that brings them down to an absolute steal at $300, great! Resisting buying the perfectly functional boots with great useful life in your favorite style, but waiting until you can save $200 is absolutely frugal in the spirit of this sub.

As have many others, I've used this sub throughout stages of my life - from starting college, to broke in grad school, and now, when I have a stable job with a good income. The basic principle here is that **there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different viewpoints, incomes, and stages of life in FMF.** The very definition of frugal when it comes to clothing may grow over time or change with your tastes, income, perceived value for certain features, style, etc.

1.	This sub probably should have been called malefashiondeals or something similar, but it isn't.
2.	An item or post is ""not frugal"" just because you wouldn't buy it or spend that amount of money.
3.	If you wouldn't buy an item or think it/the price is stupid, **DON'T POST IN THE THREAD.**

# Overview

It seems more than ever, that this sub has been overrun by comments and debates over frugality, putting an entirely unnecessary workload on the mods, as well as derailing [very useful threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/k0a6aj/i_spent_600_on_tshirts_to_find_the_best_one/). In light of this, I wanted to make a post discussing frugality and how it specifically applies to this sub. In this sub, frugality can be thought of as trying to achieve the best price on an item you want.

However, the theories of [depreciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation) and [amortization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization) are much more important to the spirit of FMF.

You can think of every piece of clothing, pair of shoes, or other fashion item as a depreciating asset. The cost you paid for it is spread out over every single time you get a use out of that item. This is why places like /r/BIFL or /r/GoodyearWelt are so popular - people naturally want to buy items that bring them a high level of satisfaction, while also having the longest possible useful life.

# Useful Life

**Timberland Boots - $90**

|Useful Life?|120 wears (2 seasons)|
|:-|:-|
|Recraftable?|No|

**GYW Boots - $250**

|Useful Life?|240 wears (4 seasons)|
|:-|:-|
|Recraftable?|Yes. Cost $100.|
|Additional Life?|240 wears|

The Timberlands work out to 75 cents per wear, after which, you would need to replace with a new pair.

For the GYW boots, this works out to 73 cents per wear. So cost of ownership here, the $250 GYW are actually cheaper than Timberland boots! And if they are well taken care of, it is possible that they can be resoled and restore again, bringing the cost per wear even lower.

I don't want to get into debates over how long Timberlands vs. certain GYW boots would last, as this will differ with every item and how people take care of them, but this principle applies to **everything posted in this sub!** From t-shirts, to flannels, to outerwear - useful life is the key.
